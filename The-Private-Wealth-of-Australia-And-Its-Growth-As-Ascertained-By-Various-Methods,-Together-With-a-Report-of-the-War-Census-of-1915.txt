PREFACE. 



As indicated by the title, the matter contained herein relates 
mainly to the private wealth of Australia, and an examination of 
the various methods adopted here and elsewhere for the purpose of 
estimating the wealth of a community. It includes also a brief 
report of the results of the War Census in respect of {a) males of 
military age, (6) net private income of the people, (c) net private 
assets of the people. Many of these latter have already appeared 
from time to time in the publications of the Bureau. 

The three principal methods of estimating the wealth of a 
community, viz., (i.) by means of a wealth-census, (ii.) by the use 
of probate-returns, (iii.) by the inventory-method based on mis- 
cellaneous statistical and other records, are considered in some 
detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. 

An estimate of the private wealth of Australia based on pro- 
bate returns was made in 1911 by Mr. A. M. Laughton, F.I. A., 
F.F.A., the Government Statist of Victoria, who obtained a total of 
Â£990,000,000, which he subsequently increased to Â£1,031,000,000. 
Reasons are given herein for the opinion that owing to defects 
inherent in the probate-return methods, this estimate is below the 
truth, and this opinion is supported by the War Census recoixls, 
which, although clearly incomplete, gave for the private wealth of 
Australia in 1915 a total of Â£1,643,000,000. A further evidence of 
the defect in the method based upon probate-returns is an estimate 
for 1915 contained herein based upon the inventory-method. This 
estimate gave a total for Australia of Â£1,620,000,000. For the sake 
of comparison an allowance should be made for items which are 
excluded from private wealth in the inventory-method, but are 
included therein at a wealth-census and in probate-returns. These 
are such assets as the locally held securities in respect of public 
and municipal debt. With this allowance the comparable inventory 
total becomes about Â£1,760,000,000 as at the 30th June, 1915, or 



Preface. 

say Â£355 per head of population. This total is an estimate of all 
the private material wealth existing in Australia at 30th June, 
1915, whether owned by Australian residents or not, with the 
addition of a sum of Â£140,000,000 estimated as the value of locall}' 
held securities m respect of loans to Australian Governments and 
local governing bodies. The portion of the Australian total be- 
longing to persons not resident in Australia is difficult to estimate 
but is probably in the neighbourhood of Â£175,000,000. 

As a result of the careful review of the several estimates, the 
conclusion arrived at is that the most satisfactory wealth estimates 
will be obtained by means of a combination of the wealth census and 
inventory inethods.

AND FROM PROBATE RETURNS. 

Together with 

A REPORT ON THE WAR CENSUS OF 1915. 



PART I â€”THE NATURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH. 
CHAPTER I.â€” INTRODUCTION. 

!â–  General. â€” The aggregate Private Wealth of any homogeneous community 
constituting a nation, together with its corporate possessions, may be called its 
National Wealth. A clear vmderstanding of the essential character of such wealth 
is important, since confusion of thought is common in regard thereto. For this 
reason it is necessary to pay attention both to the nature of its component elements 
and the means of estimating their value, as well as to the uncertainties and limitations 
of such estimates. 

In regard to ownership, the wealth of any country may mean several things, 
viz., either (i.) the wealth owned by the people domiciled therein (a) the corpus 
itself being within the country, or (6) without that restriction ; or (ii.) the wealth 
within the country irrespective of the domicile of the owner. Owing to what has 
been called the " anonymity" of capital, wealth may â€” to a considerable extent â€” 
be owned by persons not only not domiciled in a country, but even by those who 
owe it no allegiance. 

In respect of value an estimate of national wealth may be founded upon more or 
less shrewd guesses at the average wealth per unit of population ; upon rough com- 
putations based \ipon statistics of bankmg deposits, together with houses and land 
occupied ; and similar data. Such guesses, however, have no authority, since their 
degree of accurracy cannot be ascertained. A census of the wealth of a group in 
any community, either taken at random, or better, properly selected, gives a result 
of greater we'ght. Estimates may also be founded upon returns of income â€” a 
method which, however, is very precarious ; upon the value of estates of deceased 
persons, considered as representative of the rest of the community. This latter 
method would appear to have claim to considerable confidence. With proper 
precautions, doubtless any or all of these methods may well be employed. 

Estimations based on the values of the estates of persons dying have been sup- 
posed by many to be of peculiar value, iiiasinuch as the responsible evaluation of 
estates for the purposes of probate presumably furnishes results of more than ordin- 
ary accuracy. In fact, the estates of deceased persons are assumed to be, as it were, 
a most appropriate parcel, viz., one taken quite at random, and sufficiently large to 
be representative. The method of estimating the total wealth from probate retiu-na 
will consequently be exhaustively considered. The best result is, of coiu'se, fur- 
nished by a complete census of wealth, provided that the valuations are carefully 
made upon a common basis. 



2 Thw Nature of National Wealth. 

2. Value, how estimated : its uncertainty. â€” The term " Wealth" has, of covirae, 
no vinique meaning, nor is the value of anything which may be classed as wealth 
always susceptible of exact expression in terms of money. This applies more 
particularly to the corporate possessions of a people. Though the values in which 
estimates of wealth are expressed must necessarily be exchange-values, these are by 
no means fixed and unalterable, nor are they, though necessarily the common basis 
of all comparisons, readily ascertained with a high degree of accuracy. 

Wealth â€” in the sense which we are considering â€” is ordinarily represented by 
tangible securities, e.g., currency, consols, inscribed stocks, bonds, shares, real- 
estate, etc. The values of these, however, often rapidly fluctuate with public credit 
or popular appreciation. For this reason estimates of value need to be made- â€” as 
far as possible â€” in normal times, and changes of value do not necessarily represent 
actual changes in the physical element constituting the wealth. When the piu-pose 
is to ascertain the material basis of wealth the method will of course differ {e.g., the 
numbers, rather than the values of flocks and herds would then be important). 



3. Importance of clear statements as to methods of estimation. â€” It has already 
been said that mere guesses are without real value, at least for comparative piu:- 
poses, and it is evident from what has preceded, that the proper estimation of the 
total wealth of any commimity is not a simple matter. Some so-called estimates 
are little better than examples of " statistical charlatanism." 

Statistical estimates, in order to possess authority, must be well founded, 
and consequently the basis upon which they rest must be declared. When they are 
given on personal authority only, their value cannot be ascertained. For this reason 
statisticians and other publicists recognise that mere personal opinion, or a mere 
statistical ipse dixit, must not be allowed weight, not only because it lends itself to 
statistical imposition, but also because the reliableness of the results put forward 
cannot be indicated. 

In his" Sozialstatistik" (Leipzig, 1908), G. Sclinapper-Arndt sajs : â€” concerning 
certain tables purporting to give the national wealth of a number of civilised 
countries â€” that the greater part of the particulars have been merely fabricated.^ 
Very little consideration will shew the force of this remark. For, qviite apart from 
the basic difficulty of accui'ately estimating in terms of money vario\.ia forms of 
wealth, very few 2oeople can say off-hand, with any exactitude, the value of what they 
possess. Moreover, values themselves have a wide range, viz., from those disclosed 
under conditions of " forced sale" to those when sales are under the most favourable 
conditions for the seller. Hence even when a comprehensive census of wealth is under- 
taken, and all persons are required to furnish, under appropriate categories, the value 
of all material wealth possessed by them, with every safeguard to avoid repeated 
inclvision of the same items (as when encumbrances exist) the result is subject to a 
larger miargin of micertainty than is commonly appreciated. A comparison of 
estimates of value made at " boom" times with those ntiade at ordiiiary times is 
but an extreme case of this uncertaiiity. It is evident, from these and similar 
considerations, that comparisons of wealth estimated as existing at different dates are 
subject to a large measuie ot uncertainty, quite apart from that arising from the 
varying significance of the money standard, and deductions based on such estimates, 
expressed in terms of poiuids sterling, have to be used with corresponding caution.

Introduction. 3 

A careful consideration of the whole matter will disclose that among estimates of 
wealth with any pretensions to accuracy there are two, at least, which take a high 
place, viz. : â€” 

(1) Estimates furnished in a Census of Wealth (usually made by its possessors); 

(2) Estimates of wealth disclosed through death (probate returns). 

The first is usually fairly complete, and is of a precision governed by the integrity 
of the returns themselves. \^Tiere the returns do not systematically either understate 
or overstate, the final result may be regarded as of high precision. 

Although, as above stated, the second method is obviously of the nature of a 
representative parcel, it is only a partial return, since probate returns are not required 
for estates of small value, and therefore the total wealth will be vmderstated if no 
allowance be made for this fact. Moreover, for short periods the retiu'ns themselves 
are subject to a considerable measure of uncertainty as " representative parcels," 
inasmuch as large estates come luider review only with great irregularity. It will be 
necessarv to consider these limitations. 



4. Sense in which wealth is attributable to individuals. â€” A person living in any 
community may possess wealth consisting of lands, goods, or instruments of credit, 
(a) within the territoiy occ\jpied by that commv.m.ity, or (6) without it. In the former 
case there can be no doubt that such wealth is part of the communal or national 
wealth : in the latter case, the purpose of the estimate would determine whether the 
inclusion or exclusion of particular items was necessary. For ordmary purposes (6) 
would be included in estimates of national wealth, inasmuch as such wealth has 
exchange-value, notwithstanding that the corpus itself is not in the territory occupied 
by the community. There may, however, in some cases be a measure of tuacertainty 
as to the total wealth to be accredited to a country, owing to uncertainties of nation- 
ality and domicile. For example : â€” Let us suppose that A, an individual living in 
the commimity considered, has property therein of value IF, subject to an encum- 
brance of w, held over it by F, the latter being abroad. The value to be recorded is 
W^w ; and, if questions of domicile were always definite, and a census of wealth 
was complete, there could be no luicertainty in respect of the estimation of the 
communal wealth. If, however, F were only temporarily abroad, and his real 
domicile were in the commiuiity, the total wealth ought to be W, the part Wâ€”w 
belongmg to A, and the part Â«> belong to F. ^ 



5. Wealth under private ownership. â€” The term private wealth is used in contra- 
distinction to public or semi-public wealth. In Australia the term would cover all 
that wealth, the proprietorship of which resides in indi\'iduals in their private 



' The importance of questions of nationality and domicile have come into prominence thrcmgh 
recent events. Dual nationality, and the system by means of which all the res])nnsitiiliti('s of nation- 
ality can be avoided, and all its benefits secured, are reflected in (|ucstions of ownership. The estab- 
lishment also of local comi)anies almost wliolly with foreiRii capital, the propdrtion of local capital 
being merely nominal, may reduce the m-t value of large properties to a negligible <iuantity. I'nder 
the present system foreigners can establish themselves in a territory (for example where an attack 
on which is contemplated by their (iovernments). and thus, though the corpus of the wealth may be 
in the country, its legal possession aii<l cnjoA'mciit may be foreign. This shews not only that the 
difference between what may be called the geograi>hical location of wealth and the domicile of its 
ownership is of the first degree of importance, but also that the wealth of a territory may be advantage- 
ous or disadvantageous, according as its usufruct and potentialities are nationally enjoyed by the 
country in question, or by a foreign i)eople. See " Gli insegnamenti della guerra circa il trattaiiiento 
degli stranieri, " by Prof. P. Fedozzi, " Scientia, 1., xii., 1915, pp. 402-418," and 'â€¢ Nationality and 
Naturalisation," by Dr. E. J. Schuster, Contemporary Keview, Jan. 1917. pp. 93-99. 



4 The Nature of National Wealth. 

capacity, and is not vested either in the Federal Government, a State Government, 
or any form of Local Government. It thus comprises all wealth 

(i. ) which is under the dii'ect control of the individual proprietors thereof. 

(ii.) which is administered in trust or by delegation in the interest of individual 
proprietors. 

(iii.) which by the intermediary of shares, debentui-es, stock, mortgages, or 
other means is allocated directly or indirectly, wholly or m j^art to 
individual proprietors. 

(iv.) which is collectively owned by groups of private persons without any 
specific allocation to individual proprietors. 

Section (iv.) comprises such forms of wealth as the property of Clubs, Chm-ches, 
Schools of Art, Mechanics Institutes, etc. These may for certain jDurposes be con- 
veniently classed as social private weallh. 

6. Wealth under communal ownership. â€” ^In all well-developed modern com- 
mvuiities a considerable quantity of wealth is vested in local governmg bodies of 
various types, whose scope and functions are tisually prescribed by legislation or by 
regulations of the central government. These bodies include city, municipal, 
borough, shire and similar councils ; irrigation-trusts ; tramway -trusts ; school- 
boards ; hospital-boards ; fire-brigades ; watex'works -boards ; harbomr-trusts ; 
etc., etc. The property held by them covers a wide field, and includes such items 
as roads, railways, tramways, jDublic buildiiigs, plant, machinery, reservoirs, water 
channels, etc., etc. The several bodies controlling these forms of wealth are required 
to administer them in a public capacity for the benefit of the commvmity resident 
within the ambit of the jm'isdiction of the body in question. The property is in a 
sense owned by the persons who make up that community, but it is owned by them 
collectively not individually, and the constitution of the corporate controlling body 
is usually not amenable to direct alteration by the members of the community in 
question. 



7. Wealth under national ownership. â€” All those forms of wealth the proprietor- 
ship of which vests in the central governmg body may be conveniently classed as 
bemg vmder national oumership. In the case of AustraUa and other federations, 
this is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is usually not one but two such 
bodies (which divide the central control between them), viz., the Federal Government, 
and, in respect of any given part, a State Government. It will be convenient, 
however, to class the property of Federal and State Governments under the one 
general heading of iiational ownership. In Australia the principal items of property 
which are the subject of national ownership are Crown Lands, Government Rail- 
ways and Tramways ; Government Buildings ; Naval and Merchant Fleets ; 
Waterworks ; Harbour Works ; Telegrai^hs and Telephones ; Defence Works ; and 
Naval and Military equipment and material. 



8. Variation in valuation cases. â€” From the foregoing classification of ownership 
under the three heads of private, conmmnal, and national, it will read'ly be vmderstood 
that it is quite impossil)le to obtain any estimate of the value of all property on the 
basis of exchange value, suice many properties, while rendering great services to the 
community, would possess little value in exchange, owing to the absence of any 
market for the property m question. This is especially the case with many of the 



Introduction. 5 

items of commuyial and national ownership. For example, a building erected and 
eqmpped as a Parliament House or as a Public Library would be of little value, in 
proportion to its cost, for any other purpose, and thus being practically unsaleable, 
cannot be properly said to have any value in exchange. In other cases, as for example 
Government Railways, there is no doubt that if offered for sale they would realise 
high prices, but in tlie absence of any sales of this nature it is impossible for any 
one to say what their exchange value might be, and how it would compare with 
their cost of construction. Another class of property under national ownership, viz. 
Crown Lands, occupies a somewhat different position from either of the foregoing. 
In closely settled districts there is practically always a market for real estate, and 
within reasonable limits a fair exchange value could always be ascertained in 
respect of the Cro\\-n Lands in such districts. In sparsely settled pastoral districts 
on the other hand, where the land is usually occupied mider some form of lease from 
the Crown, this does not apply, and it is even less applicable in the case of the 
huge tracts of unoccupied lands which make up so large a proportion of the Crown 
Lands of Australia. Much of both of these latter classes will probably have 
considerable exchange-value in the future, and possibly in the near future, but at 
present there is no basis on which anything deservmg the name of an estimate of 
their value could be made. 

In the case of private wealth on the other hand there is not the same difficulty, 
and in most cases reasonably accurate estimates of the exchange value can readily 
be made. Thus we see that although both private and national wealth may be 
productive in varying degrees, or may even involve varying degrees of loss, and that 
these facts may materially affect the exchange value of the wealth, they are in 
themselves irrelevant. The exchange- value is the only relevant matter in estima- 
tions of jDrivate wealth, other questions may therefore be dismissed from con- 
sideration, notwithstanding that for particular purposes other bases of estimation 
may be necessary, for example the value of railway and other public services aa 
already indicated. 

9. The fluctuation of wealth. â€” ^It is important, however, to bear in mind that 
wealth is not a fixed, it is always a fluctuating, quantitj*. In a country' like Australia 
â€” a large and compact island continent â€” in which a considerable portion of the 
wealth consists of flocks and herds, the fluctuations are quite considerable, not 
merely because the physical elements of the wealth vary considerably with abund- 
ance or dearth of rainfall, but also because their exchange -values are materially 
affected by the same causes. Drought conditions, for example, may not only cause 
substantial losses in actual numbers, but also, because of the long distances to 
markets, may prejudice their exchange-values. 

It Is obvious, from considerations analogous to the above, that estimates of 
wealth to be of the highest value and to serve for comparative purposes, must be 
based upon average conditions. It follows, therefore, that a census of wealth which 
merely gives values at a particular moment will, ordinarily, but imperfectly repre- 
sent such average conditions. On the other hand, however, it rarely happens in 
extensive territories, that physical conditions are specially adverse or specially 
favourable throughout the entire area at any given time : consequently, as the 
territory embraced in any estimate is increased in size, the result of any estimate 
tends more and more to express average conditions. 

The range of fluctuation for different classes of wealth is by no means identical. 
In the case of sheep and cattle in Australia, for example, the variations of exchange- 
value are very large, while those for houses and buildings, plant and machinery, etc., 



6 The Nature of National Wealth. 

are, relatively thereto, only small. In so-called " boom times," values ascribed to 
land are vuiusually high ; at the collapse of a " boom" they are very low : national 
secm-ities fluctuate greatly with national credit, with the probability of war, or of the 
fortunes of war, etc. ; estimates for probate or other duties are usually too low, 
while estimates, made without regard to the liabiUty to duty, are likely to be too high. 

In order that a Census of Wealth should funiish a normal result, therefore, it is 
requisite that the period covered should be sufficient to fiirnish average values. The 
period over which the values are taken should conseqxiently be commensurate with 
the fluctuation periods, which, aa said, are diverse for different classes of wealth. 
A census of wealth representing values at a particular moment may be consequently 
very unsatisfactory if the selected moment should happen to be one at which other 
than average conditions obtain ; and this fact has to be kept in view. 



CHAPTER n.â€” VARIOUS MODES OF ESTIMATING WEALTH. 

1. A census of wealth. â€” A comiDrehensive census of wealth fimiishes a direct 
estimate of such part of the possessions of a community as can be expressed in terms 
of money values. Such a census indicates the wealth as referred to a particular 
moment of time, and its worth depends upon the care with which the estimates of 
exchange value are made. 

The nature of the War Census, and of its merits and limitations are dealt with 
in Parts II., III., and IV. 

2. Probate returns. â€” In practically all civilised coimtries there are what are 
generally known as " succession" duties, based upon the value of the estates which 
pass to successors in title. Owing to this a valuation has perforce to be made on the 
death of possessors. Such valuations are available in Australia in the " probate 
returns," and afford a means of gauging the wealth of the entire commmiity, foras- 
much as the returns shew the wealth possessed by a part of the community which 
can be regarded â€” as pointed out â€” as a " fair sample." 

The methods which have been adopted for ascertaining the ratio between what 
passes to successors in a luiit of time (one year) and the total wealth of the commiuaitj% 
are two, viz., (i.) the determination of the avei'age interval of time between the passing 
of estates to the successors in title, and (ii.) the ascertainment of the average rate of 
the passing of estates during any period under review. The first may appropriately 
be called the devolution-interval method, and the second the devolution-rate method. 
Obviously the two methods are â€” in the last analysis â€” essentially the same, the number 
of years in the devolution interval being the reciprocal of the annual rate of devolu- 
tion. At first sight it might therefore appear that it is a matter of little moment 
which method we follow. This surmise is, however, not correct, for reasons which 
are given hereinafter, and which, briefly expressed, are that the devolution-interval 
method is the more complicated and \mcertain, and that the corrections â€” which 
must be applied to any crude estimate of its value â€” are not readily computed or 
easily ascertained. 

3. The devolution interval.â€” Since the average length of life differs in the case 
of males and females, the devolution interval varies accoi'ding to sex : moreover, aa 
the rate of mortality is diminishing for both sexes the interval is lengthening for both. 
For this reason, if it be treated as a constant quantity, deduced estimations of the 



Various Modes of Estimating Wealth. 7 

aggregate of wealth, based upon any value founded on past experience, are con- 
sequently luisatisfactory unless they are corrected for the increased " expectation 
of life." The interval is, of course, the weighted average period between the sue 
cession to wealth in one generation and its passing on to the next. The determina- 
tion of the " weights" to be used in ascertaining the weighted average introduces 
complexity into the method. 

There is a fundamental defect in the devolution-interval method, which it is 
important to consider. It is this : â€” All wealth created durmg the life-time of any 
individual obviously operates virtually as a reduction of the period intervening 
between " successions." Thus this period, when exactly ascertained, should be 
altered by way of correction. The data, however, furnish no information by means 
of which the necessary correction can be evaluated. 

Wealth that is conveyed during the lifetime of possessors causes estimates of 
the total deduced from a correct estimate of the devolution-interval to be under- 
stated. The matter is later considered in detail. 

4. The devolution-rate. â€” The fmidanaental conception of the devolution-rate 
method of estimating the aggregate wealth is that the persons dymg during any 
period constitute a " fair sample" of the living, as regards the possession of wealth. 
If the wealth of those dying be known, that of those living could be deduced by 
multiplying by the ratio of the living to the dymg. That proportion of the dying, 
whose estates are suflficiently large to come under review in probate returns, give aa 
aggregate of wealth which is too small, and consequently the wealth of the remainder 
must be estimated in order to furnish the total wealth of the dying. 

This then is the prhiciple of the method. In applying it, however, it is necessary 
to bear in mind that the distribution of wealth varies according to both age and sex, 
and therefore the death of those dying should be dealt with according to age-groups 
and for the sexes separately. 

If the period of review be short, one year for example, the infrequency of the 
appearance of large estates in probate returns is such that it will occasion large 
discrepancies in the result deduced for successive j^ears, according as a large estate 
appears, or does not appear, in the returns. Consequently accui'ate results can be 
expected onlj' if the estimate is extended over a sufficient number of years. We 
shall see later that this should be at least 10 years in Australia. But since in 10 
years values may change considerably, the result applies, not to any moment of 
time, but represents rather â€” in any community in which wealth is increasing â€” a 
decennial average referable to a moment somewhat later than the mean of the period. 
We may call this the weighted mean, the weighting factor bemg the wealth. 

This m brief is the principle. But in detail, the matter is not quite so simple. 
Accoimt must be taken of the passing on of wealth before death, for this, by reducing 
the wealth appearmg in the probate-returns impairs their value as a " fair sample." 
Moreover, it assvunes that the death-rate depends solely upon age. If, however, the 
condition of life â€” as regards wealth â€” is affected, those represented in probate- 
returns are again not a " fair sample" of aU persons of the same sex and age. It 
is then evident that before the method can be regarded as quite satisfactory these 
featiu-es must be examuied and corrections applied if necessary. 

5. Comparison of Methods. â€” It will be necessary, later, to compare the 
estimate of wealth obtained by means of the War Census, with that obtained 
from probate returns. After a full exposition of the two, a part will be devoted 
to the discussion of any discrepancy between the results. This is the more 
necessary- as the present uistance is believed to be uiiique in respect of making 
such a comparison. 



PART n.â€” WAR CENSUS OF 1915â€” GENERAL. 



CHAPTER I.â€” LEGISLATION AND ORGANISATION. 

1. Legislation. â€” ^The War Census was authorised by the Commonwealth War 
Census Act 1915, assented to on the 23rd July, 1915. This Act provided that it 
" shall continue in operation duriiig the continuance of the present war and no 
longer, and that a census or censiises shall be taken in such States, Territories or 
parts of the Commonwealth, and on such day or days, or within such period or 
periods as the Governor-General appomts by proclamation." 

In accordance with this provision a proclamation, issued on the 25th August, 
1915 (see Commonwealth Gazette, 25. 8. '15, p. 1633), fixed the period for the 
Census of 1915 as from 6th to 15th September. A fiu'ther Act, the War Census Act 
(No. 2) 1915, assented to on 6th September, 1915, required the transmission by post, 
free of charge, of all papers provided for in the principal Act. 

Two schedules to the principal Act furnished tentative forms of inquiry, pro- 
vision being made in Section 8, of that Act, that modifications and additions might be 
prescribed. A regulation setting forth these forms of inquiry as amended in accord- 
ance with the Act was issued oia 10th August, 1915. 



2. Forms of Inquiry. â€” As already indicated, the forms of inquiry provided for 
were two. That contained in the amended First Schedule to the Act, and known 
as the ''^Personal Card,^' was as follows : â€”

This card measured approximately 8^ by 5J inches, and waa printed on white 
cartridge paper, the whole of the inquiries being made on one side of the card. 

The card prescribed in the amended Second Schedule to the Act, and known aa 
the " Wealth and Income Card,'' made provision for returns relating to (i.) Income 
for the year ended 30th June, 1915 ; (ii.) Assets owned or held in Australia at 30th

thrown on the person responsible for furnishing the desired particulars. It was 
consequently vuanecessary to provide for collectors as is usually done in census taking. 
To facilitate the return of, the completed inquiry forma, envelopes with addreaa, 
directions and caution printed thereon were made available with the cards at all 
Post Offices and postal receiving ofifices throughout Australia. These envelopes, 
slightly larger than the card (viz., 8f x 5^ inches), were printed as follows : â€” â– *â–  

* The paper for the envelopes and the cartriflge paper for the cards were made locally by the 
Australian Payier Mills. The Wealth and Income (lards were cut and printed by the Government 
Printer, Syiliicy, and tlie Persunal Cards by the (invernmcnt Printer, Mflbdurne; while the making 
and printing of the envelopes was carried out by Messrs. Sands A McDougall Ltd., Melbourne.

Directions. 

1. Every person required by the War Census Act to furnish a return is to accurately fill in and sign 

the proper form or forins. 

2. Forms for all members of any household should preferably be enclosed in the one envelope. 

3. The envelope with the contained form or forms is to be posted without delay. 

4. No Stamp is required. 

Caution. â€” Faihu'e to furnish a return renders any person required by the Act to make such return 
liable to penalty. The penalty, if the otfence is prosecuted summarily, is a fine not exceeding Â£50 or 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both ; or, if the offence is prosecutÂ«d upon 
indictment, the penalty is Â£500, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both. 

G. H. Knibbs, Commonwealth Statistician. 

4. Staff. â€” For the work of tabulation, summary and analysis, a special tempor- 
ary staff was engaged throvigh the ofifice of the Public Service Inspector, Melbourne. 
Each candidate for employment was required to pass an elementary education test, 
the main requirements of which were neatness and legibility in writing, and quickness 
and accuracy in adding columns of figures and in making horizontal extensions.^ 
The staff consisted of six divisions â€” one for each State â€” and each division was jilaced 
in charge of an Assistant Supervisor, who was either a permanent or an " exempt" 
oflficer^ of the Bureau. These assistant supervisors were placed imder the immediate 
control of the permanent Supervisor of Census. Each of the divisions was sub- 
divided into groups of approximately ten men, known as " sections," each group 
being under the guidance of a senior officer, known as a " section leader." The 
rates of pay were 10s. per day for general hands, 123. per day for section leaders, and 
2s. 6d. per day for messenger boys. At its maximum strength, the War Census staff 
totalled 550 persons of all grades. 

5. Accommodation. â€” After full consideration of the relative merits of central- 
isation and decentralisation, it was deemed desirable that the whole of the tabulation, 
summary and analysis, should be carried out in Melbourne. Fortimately sufficient 
space was obtainable in the building in which the Census and Statistics Bm-eau is 
located, provided that two shifts were worked. This was accordingly done, the 
earlier shift working from 7.45 a.m. to 3.15 p.m., the later shift from 3.30 p.m. to 



CHAPTER II.â€” RECRUITING AND WAR LOAN APPEALS. 

1. General. â€” In addition to the work originally outlined in the War Census 
Act, and the regulations thereunder, supplementary duties devolved upon the War 
Census staff, of which the most important were : â€” 

(i.) The issue of recruiting appeals to all males between the ages of 18 and 45, 
and 

(ii.) The issue of war loan appeals and prospectuses to persons who, accord- 
ing to their wealth and income card were shewn to be in possession of 
Â£1000 or upwards. 

' The large number of candidates who failed to pass this simple test shewed the necessity which 
existed for applying it. 

Â» That is, a temporary officer wtiose services could be retained for a considerable period. 

' Owing to the gtMierosity of the proprietor of the buildings, Mrs. Jane Hall, acting through her 
local riMircsentative, Mr. li. G. Casey, the use of a considerable portion of the required space was ob- 
tained rent free for a period of four months, the concession being made in view of the purpose for which 
the premises were required. 



12 War Census of 1915 â€” General. 

2. Recruiting Appeal. â€” On the 22nd December, 1915, a regulation was made 
which provided for the supply of answers to certain inquiries of which the most 
important waa that relating to willingness or vmwillingness to enlist for active service 
abroad, either then or at a later date. The following is a copy of the form of inquiry 
as set out in the regulation : â€”

The regulation referred to contamed a provision that for the purposes of the 
War Census Act 1915, the transmission of the form to the nearest local recruitmg 
centre would be deemed to be compliance with the obUgation of transmission to the 
Statistician. On the back of the inqviiry form was printed the names of the recruit- 
ing centres within the State in question, and each form was accompanied by an 

envelope addressed to " The Chairman, Local Recruitii:ig Committee ," 

the person furnishing the information being reqiiii'ed to insert the name of the nearest 
recruiting centre, and to post or deliver his reply. In addition a special appeal from 
the Prime Minister, " Tlie Call to Arms," was forwarded with each form. The 
following is a copy of the appeal. 

Commonwealth of Australia. 

THE CALL TO ARMS. 
Dear Sir, â€” Prime Minister, 15th December. 1915. 

The present state of war imperatively demands that the exercise of the full strength of the Empire 
and its Allies should be put forth. In this way only can speedy victory be achieved and lasting peace 
secured. 

If those rights and privileges for which Australian democracy has struggled so long and values 
dearer than life itself are to be preserved, Prussian military despotism must be crushed once and for all. 

The resources of the Allies are more than adequate for this task, but they must be marshalled. To 
wage this war with less than our full strength is to commit national suicide by slowly bleeding to death. 

Our soldiers have done great tilings in this war. They have carved for Austraha a niche in the 
Temple of the Immortals. Those who have died fell gloriously, but had the number of our forces been 
doubled, many brave lives would have been spared, the Australian armies would long ago have been 
camping in Constantinople, and the world war would have been practically over. 

We must put forth all our strength. Tlie more men Australia sends to the frontthe less the danger 
will be to each man. Not only victory but safety belongs to the big battalions. 

Australia tiu-ns to you for help. We want more men. Fifty thousand (50.000) additional troops 
are to be raised to form new units of the Expeditionary Forces. Sixteen thousand (10,000) men are 
re()uired each month for reinforcements at the front. 

'I'his Australia of ours, the freest and best country on (jod's earth, calls to her sons for aid. Destiny 
has given to you a great opportunity. Now is the hour when you can strike a blow on her behalf. 
If you love your country, if you love freedom, then talce yom place alongside your fellow- Australians 
at the front and help them to achieve a speedy and glorious victory. 

On behalf of the Commonwealth Government and in the name of the people of Australia, I ask you 
to answer " Yes" to this appeal, and to do your part in this greatest war of all time. 

Yours truly, 
(Signed) W. M. Hughes, 

Prime Minister of Australia. 



Males of Military Age. 13 

These appeals were sent to all males between the ages of 18 and 45, other than 
enemy subjects, who had furnished replies on the War Census personal card. The 
total number of appeals so sent was approximately 990,000. Owing to the failure 
of certain of those commmiicated with to reply, further inquiries under registered 
cover were sent to about 173,000 persons. 

3. War Loan Appeal. â€” At the request of the Commonwealth Treasurer an 
appeal to contribute to the War Loan of 1917 was sent out by the War Census staff 
ill January, 1917, to about 176,000 persons and companies resident or domiciled 
in Australia, whose net assets as shewn by their Wealth and Income Cards amounted 
to or exceeded Â£1000. The following is a copy of this appeal : â€” 

COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA WAR LOAN. 

Fourth Issue. 
Commonwealth Treasury, Melbourne, 22nd December, 1916. 

To 

Dear Sir or Madam, â€” 

1. Yoxu- attention is invited to the fact that the Commonwealth is now asking for subscriptions 
to a Fourth War Loan. 

2. It is the duty of every person in Australia to do all that is possible to speedily bring victory to 
British arms. Already there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are living but to one end â€” 
victory, which willresultintheovertlu-owoftheaggressor, the maintenanceof the rights of the smaller 
nations, and freedom from military despotism. Everything that we hold dear is involved in the 
struggle. Tlie right to govern ourselves, our means of livelihood, and oiu^ personal liberty are threaten- 
ed. In view of the slave raids of the Huns, even association with the members of our own families 
may be at stake. Patriotism and self-interest alike demand that we maintain the fight with all our 
strength. 

3. The provision of funds is just as necessary as the provision of men, and most urgently are you 
appealed to for assistance. You are asked to exercise self-denial and to contribute as much of your 
funds as possible towards the War Loan. You are asked to realize that on you depends something. 
To some extent at least the proper maintenance of the flght depends upon you. If you do not give 
for the purpose of the war as much money as you can give, then you cannot say to yourself that you 
have done as well as you should have done. Thousands of others are doing all that they can, please 
do your share. 

4. The terms of the loan have been so arranged that comparatively poor persons may subscribe. 
Those who cannot afford more, most probably could in ten months find Â£10, paying Â£1 per month. 
The enclosed prospectus gives all further particulars in relation to the Loan. 

5. Do not forget it is every man's duty to subscribe â€” so that he and his children may sooner be 
the citizens of a nation victorious and at peace. 

(i. Confidently anticipating your good wishes in this matter, and relying upon your doing whatever 
you can, I am, Yours faithfully, 

(Signed) R. Poynton, Commonwealth Treasurer. 

P.S. â€” The Commonwealth Statistician and his staff alone, who are imder a declaration of secrecy, 
are privy to the names of the persons to whom copies of this circular are being sent. 

Each circular was accompanied by a copy of the Prospectus of tlie Loan. As 
indicated on the circular, only the Commonwealth Statistician and his staff (who are 
under special obligations of secrecy) were privy to the names of the persons who were 
thus commiuiicated with. 



CHAPTER m.â€” MALES OF MILITARY AGE. 

1. General. â€” On the receipt of the War Census Cards, the work first tindertaken 
was that of classifying and tabulating the data relative to males of military age, that 
is, between the ages of 18 and 60. The whole of the War Census Staff was con- 
sequently first employed on the classification and tabulation of the personal cards, 
which were furnished in respect of males whose age last birthday was not less than 
18 nor more than 59. 

2. Enemy origin. â€” The cards were sorted initially into throe main groups 
according to whether the persons enumerated were or were not of enemy origin. In 
one group were placed the cards relating to persons of enemy birthplace, in another 
those relating to per.sons of enemy parentage but not enemy birth])lace, while tlie 
third and largest group contained all the remaining cards, i.e., all the cards relating 
to persons who were of neither enemy bii'thplace nor enemy parentage.

The number of males shewn at the Census of 3rd AjDril, 1911, between the ages 
of 18 and 60 was 1,31 1,628. On the assumption that the age distribution of the male 
population was the same at the date of the War Censvis of 1915 as at the date of the 
ordinary Census of 1911, the number of males between 18 and 60 m September, 1915, 
would have been approximately 1,433,000, thus suggesting that the number of males 
between 18 and 60 who failed to furnish the required personal cards was approximate- 
ly 83,000, or rather less than 6 per cent, of the total number of that age. Owing, 
however, to the effect of the war, and particularly to the effect of the departures of 
troops from Australia, the age distribution of the male population has altered con- 
siderably since the date of the Census of 1911. In consequence of this it would 
appear that the number of males who failed to supply the required personal cards 
was very much less than the figures quoted above. 

In connection with the record of males of enemy birthplace, it is of interest to 
note that the number of males between the ages of 18 and 60 recorded at the 1911 
Census as resident in Australia but born m Germany or in Austria-Hungary was 
16,037. 

3. Health. â€” The cards contained in each of the three groups sjDecified in the 
preceduig section were next sorted accoi'ding to health on the basis of the replies 
furnished. Each person was asked to state on his card (i.) whether he was in good, 
bad, or indifferent health, and (ii.) whether he was blmd or deaf, or had lost a limb. 

For the purpose of determining the number of military eUgibles, those persons 
who, besides being in good health, were not blind or deaf, and had not lost a limb, 
were classed as " fit." Similarly all persons who, besides being in indifferent health 
were not blind or deaf, and had not lost a limb, were classed as " doubtful" ; while 
all persons who were in bad health, or were blind or deaf, or had lost a limb were 
classed as " unfit." 

Although each person was asked on the card to state whether his health was 
" good, bad, or indifferent" the replies furnished covered a much more extensive 
range of designations than is represented by these three terms. It was consequently 
necessary, before commencing the tabulation, to compile a classification of recorded 
states of health so as to bring the I'eplies m\der one or other of three heads specified. 

On the basis of this classification the figures were distributed as follows : â€”

It may be noted that the proportions classed as " doubtful" and " unfit" were 
least in the case of persons of enemy birthplace, and greatest in the case of persons of 
enemy parentage but not enemy birthplace. Although it is probable that those 
classed as "doubtful " included some who on medical examination would be passed 
aa " fit," it is also probable that a proportion of those here classed aa " fit" would 
fail to pass the medical test. Accurate figvu-es for the proportion of medical rejects 
amongst applicants for enlistment are not available, but on inquiry the officers of the 
Defence Department stated that 35 per cent, would not be very wide of the truth. 
This proportion does not differ materially from that shewn in the above table in the 
case of persons who were neither of enemy birthplace nor enemy parentage. It would 
thus appear that the nvunber in this latter group classed as "fit," viz., 810,806, may 
be assumed, with a fair degree of accuracy, to represent the number of such males 
between 18 and 60 who were medically fit for service. 



4. Age. â€” Section 60 of the Defence Act specifies certain classes distinguished 
by age, conjugal condition, and dependents, as liable to be called upon for military 
service in the order indicated in that section. The age groups specified are 18-34 
last birthday, 35-44 last birthday, and 45-59 last birthday. For the purposes of 
tabtilation all the cards were classified according to age in these groups, the final 
group (45-59) being fm-ther divided into the two sub-groups 45-54 and 54-59. 

A classification of the data according to age is furnished in the succeeding table :

War Census of 1915 â€” General. 



Of the males of enemy birthplace of military age, 63 per cent, were between the 
ages of 18 and 45. The corresponding proportion in the case of those of enemy 
parentage, but not enemy birthplace, was 76 J per cent., while in the case of those 
of neither enemy birthplace nor enemy parentage the proportion was slightly 
under 74 per cent. 

This indicates that the males of enemy birthplace who were of military age were 
on the average of more advanced age than those in the other two groups. 



5. Conjugal condition and dependents. â€” A tabulation of the data relative to 
conjugal condition and dependents was made only in the case of those persona who, 
in respect of health, were classified as " fit." These, as indicated in Section 3 
above, comprised 843,264 persons, and represented 62^ per cent, of the total recorded 
between the ages of 18 and 60. 

Classified according to conjugal condition the particulars relative to " fit" men 
of military age are as follows : â€”

In view of the more advanced average age disclosed in Section 4, in the case of 
males of enemy birthplace, than in either of the other groups, it is surprising to note 
that this group also has a preponderant proportion of single men. 



6. Occupation.^ â€” With a view to recording the number of men of miUtary 
age who were engaged in occupations which might directly or indirectly be of special 
importance in cormection with the war, a brief classification of such occupations was 
prepared, comprising eleven classes and 71 groups of occupations. The fuial group 
(No. 71) contained all the balance not specifically included in the preceding groups. 
For the purposes of this classification the index of occupations used at the Census of 
1911 was recast on the basis of the 71 groups here mentioned. The numbers recorded 
in each group are shewn in the following table : â€”

Of the total of 1,349,597, the residuary group accotmted for 405,106, or 30 per 
cent. Agriculturists and their assistants aggregated 216,837, or 16 per cent, of the 
total, while pastoralists, dairy farmers and their assistants totalled 93,999, or 7 per 



Males of Military Age. 19 

cent, of the total for all occupations. Miners and quarrymen numbered 54,263, or 
4 per cent, of the total, while saw-millers and theii- employees niimbered 20,991, or 
1^ per cent. It will thus be seen that the four leading branches of primary production 
accounted for no fewer than 386,090, or 28J per cent, of the total males of military 
age recorded. 



7. Records and Index. â€” In addition to the work indicated above a complete 
lexicographically arranged card index was prepared in respect of the 1,349,597 
personal cards, and changes of address numbering many thousands were made 
both on the record and the index cards. Complete lists of persons of enemy 
birthplace and parentage were prepared for the information of the military 
authorities, and a record was made of the names and addresses of owners of arms 
and ammunition and the nixmber and amount so held. 



PART m.â€” WAR CENSUS OF 1915.â€” WEALTH AND INCOME. 



CHAPTER I.â€” GRADES OF OWNERSHIP. 

1. General. â€” Before any satisfactory clasaification of the wealth or income of 
the community could be made on a progressive basis, it was necessary to devise a 
scheme for the groupuag of the data in such a manner as to obviate as fully as practic- 
able the possibilities of duplication on the one hand or omission on the other. 



2. Groups adopted. â€” For this purpose the wealth and income cards were 
initially divided into six main groups, with supplementary sub-grovips as follows : â€” â–  

I. Individual Males. IV. (A.) Trustees. 

II. Individual Females. (B.) Male Beneficiaries. 

III. (A.) Partnerships. (C.) Female Beneficiaries. 

(B.) Male Partners. V. Companies. 

(C.) Female Partners. VI. Institutions. 



3. Individuals. â€” In Divisions I. and II. were included at the iiritial operation 
those cards and those only which related to individual persons who fvu-nished no 
evidence of being interested in a trust estate, whether as a trvistee or as a beneficiary, 
or in a partnership. At a later stage when the check piorposes of the initial sorting 
had been served, the individual cards relating to partners and to beneficiaries were 
combined with those initially classed in Divisions I. and II. 

Jn principle, Divisions I. and II. were identical, the only distinction between 
them being the difference of sex. Division I. relating to males and Division II. to 
females. 



4. Partnerships. â€” All cards relating to partnerships as well as all individual 
cards relating to the male or female partners were initially classed in Division III., 
the object of this primary classification being that of enabling the cards relating to 
partnerships to be compared with those relating to the individual partners. As 
indicated above the cards relating to partners were eventiially classed with those 
relating to individuals. In the case of firms trading in Australia but domiciled 
outside the Commonwealth, the card relatmg to the firm was the only card furnished. 
In these cases the partnership cards were separately tabulated and the results appear 
in the tables under the designation " Non-resident partnerships." Partnerships 
domiciled in Australia, being included in respect both of wealth and income in the 
returns of the individual partners, are omitted from the tables. 

5. Trusts. â€” AH cards containiiig particxilars relative to a trust were placed 
originally in Division IV., and were subsequently sorted into the three sub-groups 
(a) trustees, (b) male beneficiaries, (c) female beneficiai-ies. In certain cases the card 
furnished by a trustee contained the particulars of his or her own private wealth and 
income in the inner column, and those relative to the trvist estate in the outer column 
of the card, in other cases a separate card was furnished in respect of the trust. 



Grades of Ownership. 21 

Where the combined cards had been furnished a separate card was written by the 
War Census staff in respect of tlie trust particulars, which were then deleted from the 
trustee's card. If the trustee was not interested as a beneficiary in this or any other 
trust estate or in a partnership, his or her amended card was forthwith transferred 
to Division I. or II., as the case might be. The object of associatmg the cards 
relating to trust estates with those relating to beneficiaries was, as in the case of 
partnerships, to allow of a check being obtained. Owing to the impossibility of 
obtaining in respect of trust estates a satisfactory evaluation of the shares of the 
several beneficiaries, it was deemed expedient to eliminate from the returns of 
individual beneficiaries all assets shewn as consisting of interests in trust estates, and 
to shew the value of trust estates in bulk. In addition to such trust propei'ty there 
is a large body of assets held m a fidviciary capacity by life assurance and other 
societies which caimot be allocated to individual proprietors owing to the fact that 
particulars in respect of the values of policies were advisedly excluded from the 
inquiry. The total value of such property, aggregating approximately Â£52,000,000, 
has in the final results been incorporated with the bulk statement of Trust Funds. 
Similarly the net income of such societies has been included in bulk in the income 
statement. In this coimection it may be noted that in so far as premiiim income of 
these societies is concerned, each individual f virnishing an income return was instructed 
amongst other things to deduct from his gross income the amount paid in respect 
of such premimns. 



6. Companies. â€” In the initial sorting all cards relating to companies were 
classed together, and were subsequently divided mto two groups according to whether 
their head offices were within or outside of Australia. As the dividends paid by the 
companies will appear in the returns of the shareholders receiving them, and the 
value of the shares and debentxires of the companies will appear in the assets of their 
shareholders, it is clear that special precautions are necessary to avoid duplication in 
the compilation of company retxonis. With this object in view a special tabulation 
was made of the total assets shewri on the cards as comprising shares and debentures 
of companies, and a special return was obtained froin all Avistralian companies 
shewing the tmdistributed profit during the year under review, including sums 
transferred to reserves. In the final tabulation of the results the net assets of all 
companies were reduced by the amount of shares and debentiu-es in companies 
shewn as being held in Australia, the balance representing approximately the amount 
of outside capital mvested in companies operating in Australia. In the case of 
income, the wealth and income card did not furnish a means of determining the total 
income derived from dividends of companies. The special return of imdistributed 
profit mentioned above was consequently taken as furnishing for Australian com- 
panies the net income not included in shareholders' rotvirns, while for companies 
having their head offices outside of Australia the total net projits were taken into 
account. 



7. Institutions. â€” Retmns furnished by such institutions and bodies as chiu-ches, 
schools, mechani(!s' and literary institutes, sports clubs, etc., were aU classed under 
the comprehensive head of " institutions," the number of these being considerable. 
In very many cases there was, strictly speaking, no net income, as the gross income 
received was practically all absorbed in the working expenses for the year. In not a 
few cases also, there was little in the nature of net assets, the liabilities representing 
a large proportion of the gross assets. For the whole of Australia, tliis division 
represented net income of about Â£600,000 and net assets of about Â£25,000,000. 



22 



War Census of 1915. â€” ^Wealth and Income. 



CHAPTER II.â€” NET INCOME. 

1. According to States. â€” (i.) Total Net Income. In. the inquiry in respect of 
"wealth and income made by the War Census, provision, was made for the record of 
the State in which the person making the return was residing, but no provision for 
the allocation of the income to the States in which it was earned or for the allocation 
of the wealth to the States iia which it was situated. The tabular results, therefore, 
in respect of the several States, must be understood merely as gi.ving particulars in 
respect of States of domicile of the earners of the income or the owners of the wealth. â– 'â–  

In the cases of absentees the States to which the returns have been allocated 
are those in which the Aiastralian representative of the absentee was domiciled. 
Similarly the returns for Australian companies, partnerships and institutions have 
been allocated to the States in which their respective head offices are situated, while 
the retvuns for companies and partnerships domiciled outside Australia have been 
allocated to the States in which their head offices for Australia are situated. 

On this basis, and in accordance with the classification of ownership indicated in 
Chapter IV., the following classification of income according to States has been 
compiled. In all cases the figures shewn represent the net income, that is, the 
deductions indicated m the income section of the Wealth and Income Card (see p. 9) 
have been made in all cases before tabulation.

As indicated in Chapter IV., the income from Avistralian partnerships has been 
allocated in tabulation to the returns of the individual partners and consequently, 
in the above table, is included under the head of "Individuals." Similarly the 
income derived from trust funds has in the main been included in the individual 
returns of the beneficiaries. The income s^Decially shewn in the above table as from 
" trust fimds" consists mainly of the net revenues of Assurance and Friendly 
Societies, and of those estates admiiaistered by such pubUc authorities as the Curator 
of Intestate Estates, the Public Trustee, the Master in Luiaacy, etc., where no alloca- 
tion of the income to individual beneficiaries had been made. 

In the case of Comj^anies the income here shewn is the aggregate net profit in 
the case of absentee companies, while in the case of Australian companies it consists 
of the undistributed profit, inclusive of transfers to reserves. 

{ii.)Net Income of Individuals. â€” The net income of individuals shewn in the 
preceding table totals Â£241,236,552, of which Â£201,841,637 was the income of males, 
and Â£39,394,915 was the income of females. This aggregate was recorded from 
2,195,065 retui'ns, of which 2,191,945 were furnished by persons actually or usually 
resident in Australia, while 3120 of the returns related to non-residents. 



' For example, the income derived txova, pastoral property situated in Queensland, but owned 
by a resident of Sydney, will necessarily be tabulated under the head of New South Wales, as the 
War Census Schedule furnished no indication of the location of the source of income.

The estimated population of the Commonwealth at 30th September, 1915, was 
4,954,029, of whom 2,527,831 were males, and 2,426,198 were females. It will 
thus be seen that 54.60 per cent, of the males, and 33.46 per cent, of the females hx 
the Commonwealth at the date of the Census ftuiiished Wealth and Income Cards. 
For the sexea combined the number of such mdividual returns in respect of AustraUan 
residents represented 44.24 per cent, of the total population. The correspondiiig 
percentages in respect of the total population of the several States and Territories 
were as follows : â€” New South Wales, 42.35 per cent. ; Victoria, 49.17 per cent. ; 
Queensland, 43.27 per cent. ; South AustraUa, 47.07 per cent. ; Western Aiistralia, 
35.64 per cent. ; Tasmania, 38.45 per cent. ; Northern Territory, 28.99 per cent. ; 
Federal Territory, 34.46 per cent.

2. According to size of net income, (i.) Grouping. â€” Particulars relative to 
the incomes of individuals were classified vmder sixteen net income groups, one of 
which comprised those cases in which the return shewed that there had been no net 
income, or that there was a deficit. 

(ii.) Incojne of persons resident in Australia. â€” The number of cases in which the 
returns for each sex related to persons actually or iisually resident in Australia, and 
the proportion per cent, which the number of returns for each net income group was 
of the aggregate to which it contributed is shewn in the following table : â€”

It will be seen that of the returns received relative to resident males, 25 per cent. 
related to net incomes of Â£156 and upwards, while somewhat less than 4| per cent, of 
those relative to resident females were in respect of incomes of Â£156 and upwards. 
For the sexes combined net incomes of Â£156 and upwards were represented by some- 
what less than 17^ i^er cent, of the returns. 



Net Income. 



25 



The aggregate net income represented by the returns specified in the foregoing 
table was Â£240,163,204, of which the sum of Â£201,502,697 was recorded in the cards 
of males, while the cards of females accounted for Â£38,660,507. The average net 
income per card for resident males was thus Â£146, as compared with an average per 
card of Â£48 for resident females, and an average for residents of both sexes of Â£110. 
The aggi-egate net income for each income group, and the proportion per cent, in 
each case is given m the following table in respect of persons actually or usually 
resident in AustraUa : â€”

It will be seen that net incomes of Â£156 and upwards aggregated 55 per cent, of 
the total in the case of males, about 35| per cent, in the case of females, and somewhat 
less than 52 per cent, for the sexes combined. From these figures taken in conjunc- 
tion with those relative to the number of returns, it appears that in the case of male 
residents 25 per cent, of the returns accounted for 55 per cent, of the net mcome, that 
in the case of female residents 4^ per cent, of the returns accoiuited for 35^ per cent. 
of the net income, and that, for the sexes together, 17^^ per cent, of the returns 
accounted for about 52 per cent, of the net income. 

(iii.) Australian income of no7i -residents. â€” The following table contaiiis particu- 
lars of the number and proportion of net incomes u\ each group represented by tlie 
returns of the Australian incoffiea of persons who are not actually or usually resident 
in the Commonwealth. Returns relating to persons usually resident m Australia, 
but temporarily absent at the time of the War Census, are included in the tables 
in sub-section (ii.) dealmg with residents. 

Of the returns received relative to non-resident males about 30J per cent, 
related to net iiicomes of Â£156 and \ipwards. The corresponduag percentages in the 
case of females was about 46i per cent., and for the sexes combined about 393 per 
cent.

(iv.) Average net income in each group. â€” In the tabulation of data relative to 
income, etc., in groups, an approximation to the aggregate amount represented by- 
each group is sometimes obtained by ascertaining the nvimber of returns in each 
group, and then mviltiplying by some factor which lies between the limits of the group, 
frequently by the mean of those limits. Such a method reduces the work enormous- 
ly, but lacks accuracy, and on the present occasion was not adopted. The process 
followed was that of adding together all the net mcomes shewn on the returns for 
each group. The average net incomes per return deduced from these aggregates are 
shewn in the following table : â€”

It will be seen that in the majority of cases the average income for a group fell 
well below the arithmetical mean of the limiting values of the group. Amongst 
the particulars relative to residents there were two cases in which the comjiuted 
average exceeded such arithmetical means, viz., for males " under Â£50," and for 
females " Â£3000 and under Â£4000," while there was one case, viz., females, " Â£150 
and imder Â£156," in which the computed average coincided with the arithmetical 
mean of the limits. Amongst non-residents the computed average exceeded the 
arithmetical mean of the group limits h\ the cases of females and of persons " Â£1000 
and imder Â£1500," and in the cases of males, of females, and of persons, " Â£4000 
and imder Â£5000," while there was equality in the cases of females "under Â£50," and 
of females, " Â£156 and under Â£200."

The net assets shewn in the preceding table are exclusive of the property of 
Federal, State or Local Governments, and may consequently be considered as repre- 
senting the total private wealth of Australia as at 30th June, 1915. This total of 
Â£1,643,463,376 includes the Australian j^roperty of non-resident individuals, partner- 
shijDS and companies. The amount, however, so held by non-residents, cannot be 
determined with any degree of accuracy, but on the basis of the War Census returns 
it is roughly estimated that it lies between Â£150,000,000 and Â£200,000,000. It 
would thus appear that the aggregate private wealth of AustraUan residents as at 
30th Jime, 1915, was approximately Â£1,470,000,000, or nearly Â£300 per head of 
population. 

As in the case of incomes in Chapter II., the assets of Australian partnerships 
are included in the returns of the individual partners. The partnership figures 
shewn in the above table relate to non-resident partnershijis only. 



The item " Trust Funds," is made up of several categories of whicli the most 
important are the total values of trust-estates, and the Australian funds of Life 
Assurance Companies, Frieixdly Societies, and Trade Unions. 



As these funds were in every case excluded from the returns of individuals either 
by instruction as in the case of Life Assurance policies, etc., or by special adjustment 
prior to tabulation as in the case of beneficiaries in trust estates, the possibility of 
duplication of such returns has been eUminated. 



Net Assets. 



29 



In the case of " Companiea," the net assets of the Australian companies were 
taken from special returns obtained from, these companies, such net assets being 
computed without deducting the Uabihties to share and debenture holders. From 
the total net assets so computed, the aggregate amoimt of " Shares and debentures 
in companies" sheNvai on the various individual and other cards was deducted, the 
balance represeiitiiig approximately the interest iii Australian companies held by- 
persons not resident in the Commonwealth, together with the margin, if any, be- 
tween the share valuations of the several shareholders, and the valuation of net 
assets made by the company officials. 

With absentee companies, that is, comiDanies registered outside Australia, but 
trading in the Commonwealth, the procedure followed was that of includmg the net 
assets of the company held in Australia. 

(ii.) Net assets of individuals. â€” The aggregate net assets of individuals shewn m 
the preceding table amounts to Â£1,224.225,994, of which Â£921.985,433 was recorded 
in respect of males, and Â£302,240,561 in respect of females. Particulars concemmg 
the number of retxirns of residents and of non-residents of each sex allocated to each 
State or Territory are shewn in Chapter II., p. 23, the figures hi this case being, of 
course, the same for incomes as for assets. 

The aggregate net assets represented bj' such reti.u*iis are shewn in the followmg 
table : â€”

The total of Â£1,216,231,662 for residents of Australia represents average net 
assets of Â£246 per head of pojiulation. The correspondmg averages per head of 
population for the several States and Territories are as follows : â€” New South Wales, 
Â£251; Victoria, Â£282 ; Queensland, Â£193 ; South Australia, Â£279 ; Western Aus- 
tralia, Â£163; Tasmania, Â£181 ; Northern Territory, Â£176; and Federal Territory, 
Â£136. It should be noted that owing to the exclusion from the individual retiu-ns of 
interests in trust fvuids the figures here given somewhat miderestimate the net assets 
per head of population. The inclusion of such fimds with an allowance for those, the 
title to which is held outside the Commonwealth, would have the effect of increasing 
the average per head by from 15 to 20 per cent., and for the Commonwealth as a 
whole would probably give a result in the neighbourhood of Â£293. The average net 
assets per individual return recorded in respect of each State and Territory is shewn 
in the following table : â€”

the results accordmg to size of net assets, the particulars relative thereto were classi- 
fied imder 16 net assets groups, of which one comprised those cases in which the return 
shewed that the net assets were nil, or that there was an excess of liabilities over 
assets.

Net Assets, 



31 



Of the returns received from resident males, 19 per cent, related to net assets 
of Â£500 and vipwards, while about 14i per cent, of those relative to resident females 
were in respect of net assets of Â£500 and upwards. For the sexes combined net 
assets of Â£500 and upwards were represented by somewhat less than 17^ per cent, of 
the returns. 



The aggregate net assets represented by the returns shewn in the preceding 
table amounted to Â£1,216,231,662, of which Â£918,090,197 was recorded in respect 
of males, and Â£298,141,465 in respect of females. The average net assets per rettirn 
for resident males was thus Â£665, as compared with an average of Â£367 per return 
for resident females, and an average for returns of residents of both sexes of Â£555.

bulk under " trust funds." 



It will be seen that net assets of Â£500 and upwards aggregated nearly 89^ per 
cent, in the case of male residents, about 81 per cent, in the case of female residents, 
and somewhat less than 87^ per cent, in the case of residents of both sexes. From 
these figures taken in conjunction with those relating to the number of returns, it 
appears that in the case of male residents 19 per cent, of the retun^a accovmted for 
nearly 89J per cent, of the net assets, that in the case of female residents 14^ per cent. 
of the retvims accounted for 81 per cent, of the net assets, and that for tlie sexes com- 
bined somewhat less than 17i per cent, of the returns accounted for somewhat less 
than 87^ per cent, of the net assets.

Of the returns received relative to non-resident males about 34 per cent, related 
to net assets of Â£500 and upwards. The corresponding proportion in the case of 
females was about 27 1 per cent., and for the sexes combined 30 J per cent. 

The aggregate net assets represented by the returns specified in the preceding 
table were Â£7,994,332, of which Â£3,895,236 was accounted for on returns relating to 
males, and Â£4,099,096 on those relating to females. The average amount of net 
assets per return for non-resident males was thus Â£2938, as compared with Â£2285 
per return in the case of females, and Â£2562 per return for the sexes combmed. 

The aggregate net assets in each group for each sex and the proportionate 
distribution over the several groups are shewn in the following table : â€”

3. Debt, or negative wealth. â€” A complete census of wealth includes " net 
assets," not only when they are positive, but also when they are negative, that is 
when the "net return" shews the individual to be "in debt." Suppose, for example, 
A owes B Â£3000, and is possessed of wealth to the value of Â£2000. If B regarded the 
debt a perfectly good one, he would shew himself as possessed, in addition to his 
other items of wealth, of Â£3000. But A would shew that he is "in debt", on the 
whole, Â£1000. Restricted to these facts the proper return of aggregate wealth would 
obviously be Â£3000 â€” Â£1000 = Â£2000, that is, the value of the negative wealth should 
be suljtracted from the value of positive wealth. Thus any mortgagee credits himself 
only with the money lent on the mortgage, while the mortgagor virtually credits 
himself only with the value of the equity of redemption. It is clear from this that 
where the net results of the assets of any group or groups of persons are negative, 
they should strictly be deducted from the net results of the group or groups of 
persons whose assets are positive. 

Since the returns do not permit the analysis of indivitlual cases, this may 
occasionally lead to some uncertainty as to the grouping according to the amount of 
wealth possessed. ' In general, however, such grouping will be substantially correct. 

With a view to ascertaining the extent and the nature of the error involved in 
the omission of the debts shewn on the returns relating to negative wealth, a special 
tabulation of 5703 cards, shewing debt, was made from a parcel of 51,514 which 
hatl been classed as " Nil and debt." The returns in question related to several 
counties of the State of Victoria, and were taken from a total of 244,772 returns (in- 
cluding the 51,514 mentioned above), which gave a total net assets of 1 122,489,039 
when no allowance was made for the " debt" items contained in the "nil and debt " 
groups. The aggregate amount of debt so tabulated was Â£289.785, or say 2^ per 
thousand of the total covered by the class of cards from which the sample was drawn. 
In view of the relative smallness of the amount and of the evidence deduced in the 
succeeding section relative to the possible incompleteness of the War Census, it was 



34 



War Census of 1915, â€” ^\Vealth and Income. 



not deemed advisable to carry the investigation further, or to make any specific 
allowance in the aggregate for such results, more particularly as the evidence fur- 
nished by a close scrutiny of many of the so recorded " nil " cards indicated that 
further inquiry would probably disclose small net assets. 

For the purpose of analysing the progression in the returns of debts, and also 
of small net assets, and for the further pvirpose of furnishing a suitable basis for the 
estimation and analysis of material lying below the range of probate data, the follow- 
ing tables have been compiled from the returns for one of the Victorian districts : â€”

* Numbers only. t Ratio of numbers only ; amounts not known. 



4. Wealth unrepresented by material values. â€” Returns of wealth are subject 
to certain limitations which it is important to notice. Book debts, for example, may 
be under or over estimated. Consols, inscribed stock, debenture, and bank-notes 
intrinsically are not wealth, but depend upon the aggregate wealth â€” and its 
security â€” of the community issuing them. 



Suppose, for example, that a national loan of Â£500,000,000 were liold wholly by 
the citizens of any nation, the private wealth would include this amount â€” or its 
market equivalent â€” while a statement of the national wealth, that is, of the people in 
their corporate as well as in their individual capacity â€” the two being combino<l â€” 
would contain a debit item of ap])roximntely the same amount. It is quite usual for 
estimates of "national wealth" to represent merely the aggregates of private wealth, 
plus the value of works nationally owned ; such estimates therefore may be very 
misleading, for the reason above indicated. They miist not be regarded as the 
realised wealth of the nation in its entirety.

War Census of 1915. â€” Wealth and Income. 



5. Possible incompleteness of the War Census. â€” A Census hurriedly taken 
under war conditions camiot compare for completeness and accuracy with one taken 
by a large number of systematically organised " Collectors," who see that each re- 
sponsible person makes the necessary reply to the questions asked. In the case of the 
War Census the duty of making returns was perforce cast upon each individual. It 
becomes necessary therefore to gauge the measure of the completeness of the result. 
This can be roughly done by ascertaining the nvmibers in each State who failed to 
make a return, and comparing them with the numbers of all under the age of 21, 
many of which would presumably have no return to make. It may be noted on 
the one hand that in the case of females a large proportion of adults will have no 
returns to make since they have neither wealth nor income, and on the other 
hand that juniors will frequently have to make retvu-ns for the reason that they 
have one or both. The result of the comparison referred to is as follows : â€”

* That is, the total population less the number making returns. 

It is not improbable that practically all persons whose estates are of greater 
value than say Â£250, or whose incomes are above say Â£200, are recorded. It follows, 
therefore, that the correction to be made â€” if any â€” must not be a mere proportion^ 
based on the assumption that all adults should have made a return, but must be on 
the supposition that the defect of numbers represents small incomes and small 
amomits. 

These defects are serious in the case of Western Australia. The ratio to total 
males of the amount by which males " not accounted for" exceed males under 21 
for the several States and the Commonwealth are as in the upper line of the follow- 
ing results : â€” â€¢

1 If all adults only should have made returns, and the defect were proportional throughout, the 
factors for correction would have been â€” say for New South Wales â€” 435,430/412,289, 304,250/ 
304,283, etc. It is obvious, however, that the factor ought, in all cases, to be greater than unity, and 
it is obvious also that in the case of females it would give excessive results. 



Special Classes of Assets. 37 

The lower line denotes the proportion which the male "excess" referred to bears 
to the number of males making returns. 

Regarding the point that all adults might be expected to have made a retiorn, it 
may be noted on the one hand that there were on 30th June, 1915, 48,456 male, and 
62,853 female pensioners, who probably can be taken as possessing neither property 
nor income ; and on the other hand, account should also be taken of the fact that all 
persons of age 18 and upwards were required to make retiu-ns, and also juniors 
possessed of either. Again, old persons, not pensioners, living with their relatives, 
would often belong to the class possessing neither property nor income. The nvimbers 
of male, female and total pensioners in each State are shewn in the table on page 36. 

No exact estimate can be made of the defects in the returns either in respect of 
numbers or amovrnts represented, but what has been adduced shews that the whole 
measiu-e of the uncertainty is negligible as compared with that due to unavoidable 
limitations in the estimates of values, and perhaps also as to the amounts of mcome. 

Under these circumstances it has been considered advisable not to attempt any 
correction of the results obtained by tabulation of the returns received. It may be 
noted that in many cases returns, often of small amounts, were received m respect 
of children under 1 8, the particulars being furnished sometimes on a parent's card, 
and sometimes on a separate card. 



CHAPTER IV.â€” SPECIAL CLASSES OF ASSETS. 

1. General.- â€” As indicated in the preceding chapter, the principal tabulations 
of the Wealth Census data were based upon (a) States of residence, (6) Grades of 
ownership, and (c) Size of net assets. For certain purposes, it was deemed desirable 
to tabulate the gross amounts of assets shewn tmder some of the items, but owing to 
the expense that would be involved, a complete tabulation of aU the items was not 
undertaken. The items specially tabulated were (a) Cash in hand, (6) Shares and 
debentures in companies, (c) Land-values. 

2. Cash in hand. â€” -Various estimates have been made from time to time of 
the amount of coin in circulation in AvistraUa, but the figures quoted have differed 
considerably. The average amount held by the banks in each quarter is published 
regularly, but the amount in the hands of the public has proved difficult to determine 
with any degree of accuracy. 

In 1892 the manager of one of the Sydney banks estimated the amount of coin 
in private hands in New South Wales at Â£725,000, or 12s. 5d. per head. At the same 
date the amount of bank notes in circulation in New South Wales was approximately 
Â£1,500,000, making on the l^asis of the coin estimate quoted a total circulation in the 
hands of the public of Â£2,225,000, or Â£1 18s. Id. per head of population. 

In 1906 the Deputy-master of the Perth branch of the Royal Mint conducted an 
inquiry concerning the amount of coin in circulation in the hands of the public in 
Australia, and as a result gave an estimate of Â£4,200,000, or Â£1 Os. 8d. per head. 
According to this estimate tlie gold coin in circulation amoimted to Â£3,000,000, 
while the silver and copper coin amounted to Â£1,200,000. At the same date the 
amount of bank notes and of Queensland Treasury notes in the hands of the public 
was approximately Â£3,900,000. This would give a total circulation for Australia of 
Â£8,100,000, or Â£1 19s. lid. per head of population, of which silver and copper coin 
represented 58. lid. per head. 



38 



War Census of 1915. â€” ^Wealth and Income. 



According to the estimate of the Commonwealth Treasury, it appears that at the 
28th Jiine, 1915, the amomit of Australian notes in the hands of the public waa 
Â£8,626,508, or Â£1 14s. lOd. per head of population. If it be assumed that at that 
date there was no gold in circulation, and that the silver and copper coin in the hands 
of the public was on the same basis as in the 1906 Mint estimate, the amount of cir- 
culation in the hands of the public works out at Â£2 Os. 9d. per head of population, 
as compared with an estimate for Australia of Â£1 19s. lid. in 1906, and an estimate 
for New South Wales of Â£1 18s. Id. in 1892. 

In view of these estimates it would appear that the figures for " Cash in hand" 
furnished on the Wealth Census Cards were considerably below the truth, even when 
allowance is made for the fact that the returns are for part of the population only. 
The tabulated results were as follows : â€”

There is, aa might be expected, an appreciable difference between the average of 
Â£1 4s. Id. per head of popvilation shewn for the Commonwealth in the above table 
and that of Â£2 Os. 9d. deduced for the same date on the basis of estimates of circula- 
tion of Australian notes and of silver and copper coin, and, as before stated, there is 
little doubt that the War Census result is an understatement of the amoimt. Apart 
from the fact that this average is obtained by attributing a partial retiuii to a total 
population, one of the reasons for this is probably the fact that the Census was taken 
in the middle of September, 1915, and that the particulars asked for were required to 
be stated as at 30th June, 1915. Except in the case of establishments keeping books 
of accoiuit, there are probably few instances in which a correct statement of cash in 
hand could be furnished after a lapse of ten weeks. Another reason for a sliortage in 
the aggregate record of "Cash in hand" is the fact that many persons, whose possess- 
ions were only " what they stood up in," failed to furnish a return. As indicated 
in Chapter II. (p. 23), retmns were received from 1,380,208 males, and 811,737 
females, who were resident in the Commonwealth at the date of the Census. There 
were thiis approximately 1,147,000 males, and 1,614,000 females resident in Austi'alia 
from whom no returns were received. A very large proportion of these were children, 
but even taking this fact into account, it is probable that the " Cash in hand" of these 
2,761,000 unrecorded persons would aggregate a considerable sum. To make an 
average of Â£2 Os. 9d. per head, these 2,761,000 unrecorded persons would have to 
possess an average of Â£1 9s. 8d. each. Seeing that about 1,600,000 of these were 
children under 15, who would probably possess an average of less than two shillings 
each, this is an improbably large amount.

3. Shares and debentures in companies. â€” As indicated in Chapter UI. (p. 29), the 
tabulation of data concerning shares and debentures in companies was \indertaken 
mainly for the purpose of enabling an appropriate allowance to be made in the wealth 
returns to avoid the inclusion of company assets twice over. The totals obtained 
were as follows : â€”

For the piu^ose of avoiding the possibility of duplication, a special series of 
inquiries was made from companies registered in Australia. From the replies 
received to these it appears that the net assets of such companies, without making 
any allowance for liabilities to shareholders and debentiu-e holders, was Â£286,248,290 
as at 30th June, 1915. If it be assumed that the " Shares and debentures in com- 
panies" held in the Commonwealth on 30th June, 1915, were all in connection with 
companies registered in AustraUa, it would apjiear that the amount so held repre- 
sented about 61i per cent, of the total value of the shares and debentures of such 
companies, the balance being presiunably held by absentees. 

In addition, the net assets in Australia of companies registered elsewhere aggre- 
gated Â£34,323,448. 



4. Land values. â€” The total number of owners of freehold land recorded at 
the War Census was 718,569, of whom 683,849 were indiv^iduals and 34,720 repre- 
sented Partnerehips, Trust Estates, Companies and Institutions. Of the indi\-idual 
owners, 460,646 were males, and 223,203 were females. The male owners represented 
18.2 per cent, of the male population, while the female owners represented 9.2 per 
cent, of the female population. The total improved value recorded was Â£983,880.323, 
averaging Â£1,369 per owner. The corresponding unimproved value recorded was 
Â£455,876,104, or 46^ per cent, of the improved value, and the average unimproved 
value per owner was Â£634. 

Particulars concerning the unimproved values of freehold estates held by resi- 
dents of the several States and Territories are given in the following table: â€”

War Census of 1915. â€” Wealth and Income. 



A comparison of the figures fiimished by the War Census tabulation and those 
given by the Commonwealth Land Tax assessments indicates that there is not any 
marked deviation between the two sets of results in so far as estates having an un- 
improved value of Â£5000 and upwards is concerned. The Commonwealth taxation 
rettuTis are not, of course, on all fours with the War Census returns, owing in part to 
the procedure which must be followed in accmnulating the landed property of in- 
dividual landholders for taxation piurposes, and in part to the fact that the taxation 
retmns refer to taxable Crown leases as well as to freehold properties. As an ex- 
ample of the effect of the principle of accumulation, the case may be cited of a land- 
holder who has a freehold of Â£4000 unimproved value in his own right, and is to the 
extent of Â£2000 unimproved value interested as a shareholder in a company. For 
taxation purposes his estate would be classed as exceeding Â£5000, while in the War 
Census returns he would be tabulated as under Â£5000. 

The total unimproved value of estates of Â£5000 unimproved value and upwards 
was shewn by the War Census returns as Â£179,668,830. The unimproved value as 
returned by owners for Commonwealth taxation purposes for the year 1914-15 was 
Â£189,652,780, while the value ascertained by the Taxation Department was 
Â£201,363,845. In view of the facts mentioned above, these latter must be considered 
as fairly closely in accord with the War Census results. 



5. Relation between Improved and Unimproved Values. â€” In compilmg particulars 
relative to unimproved values, the corresponding improved values were tabulated in 
detail under each category, thus facilitating a comprehensive review of the relation 
between the improved and unimproved values according to States and Territories, 
and also according to size of holdings. 

Particulars in respect of the several States and Territories in which the owners 
were domiciled is fvirnished in the following table : â€”

The above results for the aggregates, both of the improved and unimproved 
values, may be represented from the second line onward by curves of the exponential 
type. Makmg the unit Â£1000, the " improved values" for the groups Â£100 to Â£1000 
are given by 



(1) 



,V,i = 71975 



etc. 



in which tn has the following values for the successive groups, viz., 0.790 ; 0.790 4" 
1(0.017); 0.7904-2(0.017); 0.7904-3(0.017); etc., the continued product giving 
the values shewn hereunder, the first value being 71975. 

The â– ' unimproved values" between the same limits are given by the expression 
(2) V'n = 199742 (0.90116)^ 

where n has the values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., for the successive groups. 

For the purpose of comparing the formula and the data, it will suffice to express

War Census of 1915.â€” Wealth and Income. 



The increase in the ratio of \uiimproved to improved values indicates that on the 
average, improvements represent a much larger proportion of the total value in the 
case of small properties than in the case of those of greater value. The corresponding

6. The distribution oi freehold estate. â€” The numbers of persons possessing 
estates the ununproved values of which were between assigned limits, are given in the 
table on p. 43. In a total of 1,000,000 these may be fairly well represented bj' the 
expression :â€”

where r has the successive values 0.490 ; 0.490 + 1 (0.052) ; 0.490 + 2 (0.052) ; 
0.490-t- 3 (0.052) ; etc. ; the continued product being as shewn hereimder, the first 
value being 379000. This expression does not hold for the higher ranges, however.

The actual number of cases was 718569, but the figures above express the 
distribution of 1,000,000 cases. 

The regidarity of the distributions of persons, and of " imimproved" and 
" improved" values mdicates that they can be used for pui-poses of prediction with 
some degree of confidence. 



7. Live Stock, (i.) General. â€” In addition to a statement of the value of assets, 
each person was required to furnish a return of the ntmiber of live stock (if any), 
possessed by him, and particulars in respect of horses, cattle, and sheep were tabu- 
lated. Apart from other uses, the classification of the horses and cattle into several 
categories furnishes important information which is not readily obtainable elsewhere. 
Owing to the faÂ«ts that the War Census returns relate geographically to the domicile 



Special Classes of Assets. 



46 



of the owners of the live stock, and not to the domicile of the live stock, and that 
much stock depastured, for example, in Queensland is owned by residents of Mel- 
bourne or Sydney, the figures obtained on tabulation for the several States do not, 
of course, accord at all closely with the rettims of live stock collected annually in 
respect of those States. The War Censtis aggregates of horses, cattle and sheep for 
the whole of Australia are, however, in fair agreement with the aggregates obtained 
from the annual returns. It is thus evident that no useful purpose would be served 
by publishing the figvu'es for a smaller area than the Commonwealth as a whole. 



(ii. ) Horses. â€” The ntmiber and classes of horses recorded at the War Census 
were as follows : â€”

The returns collected annually by the States do not relate to the same dates, 
some being collected as at 30th June, others as at 31st December, and others, agam, 
as at 31st March. The total usually given as the ntimber of horses in Australia for 
1914 based on these State returns is 2,521,272, while the corresponding total for 1915 
is 2,377,920. The former of these is approximately applicable to about the end of 
January, 1915, and the latter to the same point of time in 1916. It will be seen that 
the War Census total of 2,510,667 is in close accord with these figures. 



(iii.) Cattle. â€” The total number of cattle recorded at the War Census was 
9,863,036, distributed as follows : â€”

The total ntunber of cattle shewn by the aggregate of the State annual returns 
for 1915 was 9,931,416, a figure which is fairly in accord with the War Census result 
given above. The State annual returns for 1915 gave a total of 1,684,393 dairy 
cattle, milking and dry, as compared with 1,746,433 recorded at the War Census.

War Census of 1915. â€” -Wealth and Income. 



(iv.) Sheep. â€” In the case of sheep the War Census total for September, 1915, 
was 68,124,100, as compared with an aggregate for 1915 of 69,257,189, compiled 
from the State annual returns. 



8. Vehicles. â€” For the purpose of obtaining a register of the privately -owned 
means of transport that were available in Australia, each person was asked to fur- 
nish on his W^ealth and Income Card the number, purpose, horse-power, etc., of any 
vehicles in his possession. 

The geographical distribution of the data is, in this case as in all the others, 
dealt with in the Wealth Census according to domicile of the owners, not according 
to the location of the vehicles. Although there are probably many cases in which 
vehicles situated in one State are the property of persons resident in another 
State, such instances are not nearly so numerous as is the case with live stock, and 
conseqxiently the figures obtained for the several States and Territories may be taken 
as furnishing a rough indication of the geographical distribution of the vehicles 
themselves. On this accomit the figures for States and Territories are given in the 
succeeding tables : â€”

The Correlation of Wealth and Income. 



49 



the distribution of these is given according to ranges of income and ranges of assets, 
the aggregates for each range of income, and for each range of assets being also shewn. 

If these distributions conformed perfectly to curves of a known type it would 
be possible to compute the mutual relations of wealth and income. Owing to limita- 
tions of numbers, however, and to the incompleteness of the returns, the progressions 
of the numbers only approximate to well-defined (and smooth) curves. 

The figures given in this part relative to income and assets relate in each case to 
" net income" and " net assets."

The Relation between Wealth and Income. 



3. Numbers in each State and Territory arranged according to given limits of 

income. â€” In the following table are given the miniljers of males, females and persons 
whose incomes lie Ijetween the limits indicated m the first column. The general 
si'miZani?/ of the distributions for each State is obvious, although by no means iden- 
tical ; the measure of their agreement or difference can only be fully appreciated by 
expressing each as a ratio to the totals in the last lines. The calculation of these 
ratios has not, however, been undertaken.

4. Aggregates of income in each State according to given limits of income. â€” In 

the following table are shewn for each State and the Commonwealth the aggregates 
of the" net incomes" for males, females and persons arranged according to limits 
of income, which correspond to the numVjers given in the precedmg table. The totals

for the Commonwealth agree, of course, with the final column m the tables of sections 
1 and 2 of this chapter. The identity or difference of the distributions (of Liicomes) 
is revealed by dividing by the totals in the final lines. The ratios so found shew how 
the aggregates of incomes in the various groups are distributed according to the 
magnitude of the income. This relative distribvition has been given for the Common- 
wealth as a whole on p. 25 for each sex and for persons.

6. Numbers in each State arranged according to given Umits of assets. â€” In 

the following tal)io are slicwn the nuiiihers of males, females and persons whose 
" net assets" lie Ijetween the limits shewn in the first column. These numbers have 
therefore no immediate relation with the arrangements according to " net incomes." 



The Correlation of Wealth and Income. 



The ratio of each to the total at the bottom of the column in which it is found 
shews the relative distribution of persons according to ranges of assets, and, if 
tabulated, would reveal the degree of identity or difference between the several States 
and Territories of the Commonwealth. They have not been regarded as of sufficient 
importance to tabulate. This tabulation has been already given for the Common- 
wealth as a whole, however, see p. 30. 
Commonwealth, States and Territories.â€” Number of Returns in Respect of Individuals 
in each Assets Group as at 30th June, 1915. (Exclusive of Absentees.)

7. Aggregate assets arranged according to given limits of assets.â€” The numbers 
in the following table are the aggregates of the wealth possessed by the males, females 
and persons respectively shewn in the table of section 6. Like them they have 
no direct relation with the numbers arranged according to the magnitude of income. 
The ratio of each aggregate of assets for each asset-group to the total of these 
aggregates (at the foot of the columns) is by no means identical for each State. 
The ratios would shew the relative distributions according to the magnitude of the 
assets ; they have already been given for the Commonwealth as a whole, viz., on 
p. 31.

S. The average incomes, assets, and ratios of incomes to assets, States and 

Commonwealth. â€” In the taljles hereunder are given lor eacli State and the Common- 
wealth, and for males, females, and persons, the average net incomes and average 
net assets and the ratios of the former to the latter, arranged according to given 
limits of income. The average incomes are necessarily very nearly similar for 
males, females, and persons, i.e., they necessarily lie between the limiting values 
of the range, and usually between the middle of the range and the terminal thereof 
on the side of the smaller income, since in most cases the numbers diminish as the 
income increases. This table is important as shewing the way in which the income 
associated with the possession of particular amounts of wealth varies from State to 
State. 



The Correlation of Wealth and Income.

Fig. 1. 



Fig. 1 furnishes a representation of the ratio which the net incomes of any 
given size bears to the net assets which, on the average, are associated therewith. 
The base hne indicates net income, while the ordinates to the cvtrves denote for 
any given net income the ratio which such income bears to the average net assets 
associated therewith. The c\irve marked M relates to males, that marked F to 
females, while the intermediate curve marked P relates to the sexes combined. 
The dotted horizontal line marked M represents the average ratio of net income 
to net assets, that marked F furnishes a similar representation for females, and 
that marked P for the sexes combmed. The contiguity and similarity of the curves 
for persons and for males are due to the marked preponderance in the number of 
the retiu-ns for males. 



9. The significance of income as related to assets. â€” The last three tables of 
section 8 shew that for males and females in all the States the percentage of income 
on assets increases rapidly with increasing income to a certain point, and thereafter 
diminishes. Amongst males this maximum is reached in the income group "Â£150 
and under Â£1.5(j" in the cases of Western Australia and the Federal Territory, and 
in the income group " Â£100 and under Â£1.50" in all the other States, in the Northern 
Territorj-, and in the Commonwealth treated as a whole. Amongst females the 
maximum percentage occurs in the income group " Â£50 and under Â£100" in all the 
States except Western Australia, in the Federal Territory, and in the Commonwealth 
as a whole. In Western Australia the female maximum occurs in the group Â£150- 
Â£156, if the abnormal result in the two highest groups be ignored, while owing to 
smallupss of numbers the Northern Territory figures vary irregularly. The position 
of the maximAim for the sexes combined agrees with that for males, except in the 
case of South Australia, where the maximum occurs in the Â£150-Â£156 group instead 
of the Â£100- Â£150 group. This variation is evidently due in large measure to the fact 
that incomes between the ranges of Â£50 and Â£300 amongst males and between Â£50 



The Correlation of Wealth and Income. 61 

Â«,nd Â£150 amongst females are very largely derived from personal exertion. It may 
be noted in this connection that 80 per cent, of the male returns received, and 69 
per cent, of the male income recorded, lie between the income limits of Â£50 and Â£300. 



Incomes below Â£50 and above Â£300 are much more largely derived from property 
than is the case with the incomes mentioned above, and consequently in these cases 
the percentages obtained approach more nearly to the rates of profit derivable from 
the investment of capital. Probably in no class is the personal element entirely 

eliminated, and hence all the percentages shewn will probably exliibit an advance on 
normal rates of profit. For incomes above Â£500 the percentage for males for the 
whole Commonwealth varies from 14.09 per cent, to 8.72 per cent., while in the 
â– similar field for females the variation is between 12.50 per cent, and 7.88 per cent. 



10. Comparison with other countries. â€” A complete comparison of the distribu- 
tion of incomes and wealth between Australia and any other country is not possible, 
since the necessary information has not â€” as far as is known â€” been collected and 
tabulated. Some idea, however, can be had of the relative positions between 
Prussia in 1911, and Australia in 1914-5, as regards wealth and associated income. 



The Statistical Year-books for Prussia, containing returns relating to the Prussian 
Income Tax and Property Tax, ftu-nish the values of incomes and of property. The 
1912 volume gives incomes said to be for the year 1912, and the 1913 volume ampli- 
fies the values of property, said to be for 1911, which are commenced in the 1912 
volume. It appears, however, from a table on page 301, that, so far as the Property 
Tax is concerned, an assessment is made once in three years. There are figitres for 
the individual years 1905 and 1906, but subsequent figui-es relate to the periods 
1899-1901, 1902-04, 1905-07, 1908-10, and 1911-13. It may, therefore, be reasonably 
assumed that the Property Tax Returns (said to be for 1911) can be applied to either 
of the three years 1911, 1912, or 1913, and that they refer to the same population 
â– as the Income Tax Returns (said to be for the year 1912). 



Tlie income figures are given for six large groups subdivided into a large number 
of smaller groups, rising by Â£15 up to Â£225, then by Â£25 to Â£475, and then by Â£50, 
Â£75, and Â£100 to Â£5000, etc., etc. The property figures are given for eight large 
groups subdivided into a large number of smaller groups, rising by Â£100 up to 
Â£1200, then by Â£200 up to Â£3000, then by Â£500 to Â£10,000, by Â£1000 to Â£50,000, and 
â– afterwards by larger amounts. 



It may also reasonably be assumed that the 1,767,034 persons with property 
exceeding Â£300 are contained in the 6,906,497 persons with incomes exceeding Â£45, 
but, apart from the fact that it is a fair assumption that the four persons with the 
largest incomes (total Â£2,152,500) are the same four persons who are jiossessed of the 
largest properties (total Â£42,599,000), it cannot be assumed that the persons in any 
â– one group of incomes wholly correspond to the persons in any group of property, 
and certainly as the incomes become smaller this observation more and more strongly 
â– applies. 



62 



The Relation between Wealth and Income. 



In the table hereunder the results are compiled according to the range of income 
shewn in column (ii.), the corresponding nximber of persons being shewn in 
column (i.). For the wealth possessed by identical numbers of persons, the aggre- 
gates were made iip from the bottom of column (i.), the corresponding aggregates 
of wealth being shewn in column (v.). This enabled the average income and average 
wealth of each class to be ascertained. As already stated, the individual persons in 
column (i.) are not the same for the wealth aggregates as for the income aggregates, 
that is, they are identical numbers of persons, but are 7iot identical persons, and ^jrob- 
ably the non-identity as to persons greatly increases for the larger numbers (in the 
higher parts of the table). Hence the ratio of the averages does not represent the 
ratio of the income accruing to the groups of persons possessing given aggregates of 
wealth. 

The table is nevertheless of value as shewing independently the average incomes 
enjoyed and average wealth possessed by separate groups of equal numbers of people 
more or less differently constituted as regards the individual incomes and the in- 
dividual aggregates of wealth. 

The results in the final column (ix.) are deduced in a similar way from Australian 
data, and, bemg made up in the same way, ftu-nish a very fair basis of comparison.

It will be noticed that the ratios are invariably higher in Australia ; that is, the 
incomes are larger in relation to the wealth possessed than they are in Prussia.

64 The Relation between Wealth and Income. 

CHAPTER II. -THE WEALTH AND INCOME SURFACE. 

1. Correlation of income and assets.^ â€” Reference has already been made to the 
association of income and -wealth in the Australian and in the Prussian retiirns. 
This association will now be fvirther considered. If, for each income-group and its 
associated asset-group, the number of persons be ascertained ; and if, moreover, the 
ranges of income axe the same throughout, and the ranges of asset are also the same 
tliroughout (tlie two not necessarily being equal), these numbers can be represented 
as a system of parallelepipeds on the double-ranges as basic areas. They thus form 
a species of " stepped" surface, which, when the ranges of income and asset are both 
made indefinitely small, becomes a continuous or smooth siu-face. We shall con- 
sider the natm-e of this surface. 

In order to fully exhibit the correlation of income and asset, and consequently 
to fully appreciate the' significance of the tables of Chapter I. of this part, section 
1, it is necessary to ascertain the (average) frequency with which a given 
amount of wealth is associated with a given income. Since for a given income the 
numbers ( N) included in small ranges of wealth vary (sensiblj^) as the ranges â€” and 
the same observation applies also when, for a given amovmt of wealth incomes are 
considered, it follows that the number of persons in each do\ible-entry range must be 
divided by the product of the corresponding range of wealth and range of income, in 
order to exhibit the comparable freqxaencies. The quotient is the average per square 
unit (wealth by income) throughout the double range (roughly at the common centre 
of the two ranges). Or since 8 JVx Sx, and as Sy, therefore as bxhy, we shall have 
for the vertical height z. 

(1) z ^ 8N / (SxSij); or 2^ = N i,c,pq / {^c â€” ^b) iVq - Vp)' 

in which expression b and c are the limits of the range of wealth, say, and p and q 
are those of the range of income for the number of persons N. Obviously 
z = f (x, y), and if we can ascertain this function, we shall be able to determine the 
values for any ranges whatsoever, since 

(2) ^6c,j,5/ p = ^ -Jb /lU^'^^y) '^"^'^y' 

in which the absolute number N is the number between the ranges be and pq in 
question, and ^ denotes the proportion of this to the population P. In this case the 
value of the double-integral between the widest possible limits is taken as unity. 

The data from which the wealth-and-income surface can he deduced is shewn in 
the following tables, which give the number of males and females respectively, out 
of a recorded total of 1,380,208 males, and 811,737 females, whose incomes and whose 
assets each range through Â£1 sterling at a position approximately at the centre of the 
several ranges. In order to reduce the number of decimals to be expressed, the 
quantities found by dividing the product of each range of income by the range of the 
3orresponding asset have all been multiplied by 1000. The tabular quantities 
therefore are 1000 times the average taken over each range of income and its associ- 
ated range of asset. ^ I shall call this surface the plutoprosodic surface. " It is not 
very regular, but can be defined with considerable precision. 

1. Inste.ad of regarding these quantities as referable to the centres of the ranges, in order to define 
the continuous wealth-and-iiiciniu' (phitoprosodic) stirlace, the result will be more satisfactory, but not 
quite correct if referred to tlic averauc values of incmiie and average values of asset. The labour of 
applying necessarily small correct ions to these resvdts in order to make theTu rigorously accurate, is not 
justified, in view of the various limitations of the data, see figures â€¢>. and 3, page 66, shewing the 
surface. If the quantities in the table are divided by 1,000, they give tl\e numbers of males and fe- 
males who .are included on the average in a range of xto x+\ pounds sterling income, and ;/ to ;/ + 1 
pounds sterling wealth ; the average extending all over the double-range A'l to A'a and Ti to \\. 

2. From ttXoOtos, wealth, and 7r/)o(To5os, income as opposed to principal, or tt/joctoSu-oj, apper- 
taining to income.

3. The graphs of the plutoprosodic (or wealth -and-income) surfaces. â€” The upper 

graph represents the plutoprosodic surface for males, and the lower graph the pluto- 
prosodic siu-fa^e for females, by means of contours shewing the number per square 
unit (multiplied by 1000), possessed of any given income and any given wealth. 
Thus, if any contour be followed, say 10, on the graph for males, a succession of 
points taken thereon shews the wealth and incomes associated with that degree of 
frequency, while if a succession of points taken on contoiu- 20 be followed, the fre- 
quency will be double. Thus wealth Â£3000 associated with incomes of Â£495 occur 
as frequently in Australia as wealth Â£5000 associated with incomes of Â£2(5G, and 
bothoccur with half the frequency with which wealth amounting to Â£2500 is associ- 
ated with incomes of Â£412. 

The numbers for the curves marked a i are as follows : â€”

The immense advantage which the graph possesses as com]iared with tabidar 
results is obvious from the above illustration of its interpretation : it is only by means 
of the contoxirs of the plutoprosodic surface that the way in which wealth and income 
are associated in any commvuiity can be completely defined.

The Relation between Wealth and Income. 



4 Freciuency according to income and wealth.â€” In order to observe the change 
of frequency for any given income, the co-ordinate value is taken on the left hand 
vertical line, and the intersection with the contours of the horizontal line with this 
value gives the relative frequency according to the wealth corresponding. 

Similarly, for any given amount of wealth the co-ordinate value is taken on the 
top horizontal line, and the intersection with the contours of the vertical line with this 
value gives the relative frequeuf y according to the income corresponding.

shewn by figures written on the contour lines. These denote the numlier of persons in the tot;il< con- 
sidered, nuiltiplied by 1000, for a range of Â£1 of wealth and Â£1 of income. The intersection of the 
vertical lines witli the contoiu-s shews the freciuency with variations of income for given values of wealth. 
Similarly, the intersections of the horizontal lines with the contours shew the frequency for given 
incomes with variations of the amount of wealth. 

Where the ranges of wealth or income, or both, are more extended than one pound sterling, the 
frequencv numbers should be multiplied by the product of the two ranges and divided by 1000. 
Thus, if the range of wealth be from Â£7000 to Â£7500. and that of income from Â£500 to Â£510, the 
nnUtiplier will be 500 x 10 = 5000. This divided by 1000 gives 5, the factor to be multiplied into 
the frequency value as shewn. It will be sufficiently accurate to adopt the value of the contour pass- 
ing through the centre of the range-area in question. For males this is approximately 2.45 : the 
required frequency is therefore 12.25 : similarly for females, and with the same double range, the 
required frequency will be 0.864 x 5 = 4.32. 

It will be observed that the surface for males is fairly regular, but that for females is very 
irregular. The irregularities are probably accidental, and with larger numbers would most likely 
disappear. 

The values of curves a i have been referred to in the preceding paragraph. 

The plutoprosoiic surface, it will be seen, represents the whole system of relations that e.xist 
between wealth and income, by means of a three dimensional figure on which the contours are the 
intsrsections of planes parallel to th3 bas3 at the successive heights indicated by the figures. 



PART V. 
THE ESTIMATION OF WEALTH FROM PROBATE RETURNS. 

CHAPTER I.â€” THE INTERVAL OF DEVOLUTION. 



1. The interval of devolution method. â€” The method of determining the aggre- 
gate of private wealth from the aggregate amount appearing as inheritance, by taking 
accoLint of the average interval between the inheritance and the passing on of an 
estate, lt the average interval between " successions to title," is known as the 
" interval of devolution'" method. It is a metliod that has been used more frequently 
than any other. We shall consequently refer to it at some length, and may point out 
that it has recently been discussed by Mallet, ^ and very fully and more recently 
by Corrado Gini. ^ 

In this method, as employed l)y Mony, 1877, and by Bailleux de Marisy, 1878, 
it was assumed that the mean dviration of life could be regarded as the devolution 
interval. Ten years later Verrijn Stuart, viz., in 1888, made the same assumption, 
as also did F .S. Nitti quite recently,' viz., in 1904. In December, 1878, L. Vacher 
pointed out that the devolution-interval should be the arithmetic mean between the 
times when persons receive, and when they transmit to their heirs, their inheritances. 

This suggested the idea that a fundamental period to be ascertained was the 
"duration of a generation" determined as the interval between the births of parents 
and children, but it was demonstrated by Coletti that increase in the duration of life 
could sensibly distm-b the coincidence of the interval between the births and that 
between the deaths. It was simultaneously pointed out by Gini, and by Lavergne 
and Henry, 1908, that there is a sensible difference between the interval from the 
deaths of parents to the deaths of children, and the interval between the deaths 
of testators and the deaths of their heirs ; in fact, that the latter interval is apjjreci- 
ably shorter owing to the influence of " successions" by collateral relatives, the 
widowed, and 'strangers in blood.' Mallet, in 1908, ascertained the devolution- 
interval by computing the mean duration of the life of heirs by means of life-tables. 
In 1909, March indicated another method based upon the difference in the mean age 
of testators and the mean age of their heirs (intervalle moyen des vmtations sticcessives). 

It was not long before it wtis perceived that the amount of the " succession" 
was of importance in forming the " average interval." Mony, Bailleux de Marisy 
and Vacher took cognisance of this, and de Foville shewed that it is also necessary 
to add the amount of settlements (donazioni), which are, of course, virtually anticipa- 
tions of inheritance.

The Interval of Devolution.

Gini shewed that the interval between two settlements was sensibly equal to the 
interval between two successions. Attempts to evade the pajTnent of duty reduce 
the amount coming into evidence, and Vacher endeavoured accordingly to ascertain 
the magnitude of the evasions, with the result that he â€” and others also â€” found that 
the ascertained amounts did not agree with the estimations made by officials of 
various departments of Finance. In the attempt to obtain a multiplier from the 
average devolution-interval for individual estates, Gini pointed out that the arith- 
metic mean is unsatisfactory, and that the harmonic mean should be used ; and 
further, that many estates are ceded by persons of advanced age against service to be 
rendered to them or their descendants ; and yet again, that it is very important that 
account should be taken of the influence on the annual amount of devolution of 
variations in the wealth of a country. No method is quite free from this difficulty. 



2. Determination of the interval of devolution. â€” The duration of a generation, 
regarded as the interval between two successive generations, was determined directly 
by Turquan. Using 4^ million schedules, he computed that from years 1892 to 1896 
the average age of fathers of " legitimates" (so-called) in France, was 33 years 
7 months, and that of mothers of " legitimates" 29 years 10 months 13 days. 
In -the following table the results are given for a number of countries, as well as the 
period to which these dates apply : â€”

The preceding examples may bo called instances of determination by the direct 
method. Riimelin ajipears to have been the first to adopt an indirect method. In 
this the mean ages of the persons marrying are ascertained, and the interval between 
marriage and the birth of the first cliild, and half the mean interval between the birth 
of the first and last child. In tliis way the interval between the births of the parents 



70 



The Estimation of "Wealth from Probate Returns. 



and that of the middle child is presvimed to be sufficiently well ascertained. Riimelin 
found the interval between marriage and the birth of the first child to be one year ; 
between the births of first and last child 12.2 to 12.5 years ; and thus the interval 
between marriage and the birth of the middle child to be slightly over 7 years. By 
this method he calculated the average interval between the births of parents and of 
children to be as follows : â€” Germany, 36.5 ; England, 35.5 ; France, 34.5 years. 
This method is, of coiu'se, not accurate, because the interval between marriage and 
the birth of the fii'St child cannot be regarded as exactly one year. Four years' 
experience in Australia, for example, gives the result 1.19 years, and shews that the 
interval varies with the age of the parent (in this case the mother), the result being 
as follows : â€”

Again the children do not follow at equal intervals, and there is little doubt that 
the interval differs somewhat in different countries. 

Vacher adopted an indirect method, which may be described as follows : â€” 
Let n equal the number of births occurring in the ith year after marriage. Then the 
sum of the products m divided by the total births gives the average interval between 
marriage and the birth of all children, i.e. : â€” 

(1) io = 2(m)/ Sn 



This average interval i^ added to the average age of persons marrying gives the 
interval between the birth of parents and births of all children. In this way Vacher 
found 33.06 for France in 1880. It has been wrongly assumed that the methods are 
equivalent ;. they give, however, sensibly different results. The character of these 
methods was discussed by Gini, who makes the following observations : â€” " With 
Vacher's and Riimelin's methods the interval between births of parents and children 
is not accurately ascertained, but the method gives the interval between the births 
of all persons marrying, whether prolific or not, and the births of the children. 
Since the non-prolific marrying are as a rule older than the prolific, the interval 
between the births of parents and children computed by this method is too large. 
Moreover, even prolific parents enter into the results in a different way by the various 
methods. In the method of Turquan, a parent is taken account of in the computa- 
tion each time he has a child, whereas in Rvimelin's method the parent enters once 
only. Moreover, as more prolific parents are ordinarily younger, Riimelin's method 
will give a higher interval than Turquan's. Vacher's method gives a still higher 
figure than Riimelin's, since each parent, tho^lgh he appears but once in the cal- 
culation of the age of persons marrying, nevertheless appears as many times in the 
calculation of the interval between marriage and birth as he has children ; and 
further, the parents who have more children shew a larger interval between the 
birth of the parent and the birth of the middle child. Gini gives an instructive 
example, which may be here reproduced as illustrative of the significance of the 
difference of the methods. 



The Interval of Devolution. 71 

Example. â€” Let there be 3 families, in which, in the period 1890-1900, 7 children 
were born, \iz., 5 as issue of a fatlier born in 1870 and mai-ried in 1889, born in the 
years 1890, 1891, 1893, 1897, 1900 ; 2, aa issue of a father bom in 1861 and married 
in 1890, born in the years 1893 and 1895. The third husband, bom in 1850 and 
married in 1889, let it be supposed has no issue. 

(a) Method of Turquan. â€” Average age of fathers at the birth of children: â€” 

= 4 (20 + 21 + 23 + 27 + 30 + 32 + 34)= 26.7 

{h) Method of Rumelin. â€” Interval between birth of father and birth of 
middle child : â€” 

= i (19 + 29 + 39) + 11 i (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 11)+ \ (3 + 5)[ = 33.6 

(c) Method of Vacher â€” Interval between birth of fathers and births of 
children : â€” 

= J (19 + 29 + 39) + i (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 11 + 3 + 5) = 33.9. 

Thus Vacher gives a larger number than Rumelin, and Rumelin a larger number than 
Turquan. 

The data for Paris and also for New South Wales shew that the results obtained 
according to Tiu-quan'a and Vacher's methods are not the same, the difference for 
Paris araomiting to 2.6 years for males, and 3.5 years for females ; and in New South 
Wales to 2.7 years for males, and 2.9 for females. In this instance Gini states that 
Riimelin's method cannot be employed. 

Li discussing which of the three methods is jDreferable, Gini makes observations 
that may be summarised as follows : â€” From the demographic point of view the 
difference between ages of parents and children is of importance, as this is the interval 
between two generations ; and the schematic example given indicates that it might 
be obtained as follows : â€” 

I (1890 + 1891 + 1893+1897 + 1900+1893 + 1895) â€” 1 (1870+ 1861) = 28.6 ; 

the first part denoting the years of birth of sons (7) and the latter of the fathers (2). 
From the economic point of view, i.e., in the case of the valuation of the private 
wealth of a country, Gini affirms that it is important to recognise that : â€” â€¢ 

If the property left by a jDerson is derived entirely from his own thrift, then the 
amount of the properties left at their deaths by the children of two generations will 
be in proportion to their numbers. In that case the method of Turquan should be 
used, as it takes the age of parents into account every time they have children. 

But of properties left to successors it not infrequently happens (in Europe at 
least) that only a relatively small portion is due to thrift, the greater portion having 
been inherited. The amount of property left by the children at their deaths will 
therefore be less than proportionate to their number. Turquan'a method would, 
therefore, by taking the interval between the births of parents and children, furnish 
too small a result for the calculation of the private wealtli. 

It ought also to be observed that in order, at any given moment, to obtain the 
average devolution-interval (denoted by Gini by i^i) we must determine the mean 
interval between the births of parents and children, not merely for those persona who 
actually register children, but for thoae persons who actually die. in the meantime 
the average age of persona marrying, the interval between marriage and tiist birth 
and the interval between first and last births, may have altered. 



72 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

The whole position maj-, therefore, be summed up as follows : â€” The various 
methods (Vacher, Riimelin, Turquan) adopted in the determination of the duration 
of generations are not at all equivalent, and lead to sensibly different results. For 
the pvu-pose of the calculation of private wealth none of them is exact, as the resialt 
according to Turquan is too small, and according to Vacher and Riimelin too large. 
It is, therefore, necessary to be satisfied with I'ough approximations. In another 
direction, a source of error lies in the fact that in the case of persons dj- ing the interval 
between births of parents and births of children is taken as equal to that found for 
persons who at that time register the birth of children. 

Those who deduce the interval of devolution from the interval between the birth 
of parents and the birth of children, regard this latter as coinciding with the interval 
between the death of parents who have survived grand-parents and the deaths of 
children who siu-vive parents. 

Setting the data out in the form of inequalities, Gini has shewn that : 

(a) If it be assmned that the interval between the death of parents and the 
death of surviving children corresponds to the interval between the 
birth of parents and the birth of their children, an error is made which, 
according to the nature of the cases, may lie in either direction, but the 
amount of which is generally not very serious. 

(6) If the mean dviration of life remain constant, the interval between the 
birth of parents and the birth of their children is greater than the inter- 
val between the death of parents and the death of surviving children. 

(c) If the mean duration of life increase, there may be a difference in the 
opposite direction. It will certainly be an advantage if the increase 
in the duration of life can be taken into account. But we have to con- 
sider that the influence of that increase is more complex than has hitherto 
been believed, and that the increase in the mean diu-ation of life is 
different, and probably very different (?) in the case of heirs from that 
of the total population {op. cit, pp. 60, 61). This deduction is of 
doubtful application in Australia. 

He adds further that those avithors who have calculated private wealth by the 
method of the interval of devolution have assumed that this interval corresponds 
to the mean interval between the death of parents leaving property and the death of 
children inheriting property, an hypothesis, however, which he points out is not in 
accordance with reality {tale ipotesi non corrisponde a realfd). He has shewn by an 
example which, though only schematic, leads to substantially correct conclusions, 
that the interval of devolution is notably smaller than the interval between the death 
of parents leaving property and the death of children inheriting {ibid., pp. 61-63). 

Dividing testators into three classes, viz. (i.) married or widowed persons with 
issue ; (ii.) married or widowed persons without issue ; and (iii.) unmarried persons ; 
and making certain suppositions which, even when they are not strictly true, do not 
sensibly prejudice the result, he establishes mathematically that the intei'val of 
devolution is appreciably smaller than the mean interval between the deaths of 
parents and the deaths of their children. These suppositions are : â€” 

(a) That the possessors of property of one generation die before those of the 
following generation ; he discusses also the limitations to this supposi- 
tion. 



The Interval of Devolution. 



73 



(b) That the heirs of a married person 'with pre-deceased issue' are the widow, 
widower, or the (siirviving) children ; and that the heirs of a widower 
or widow are the children ; that the heirs of an unmarried person are 
brothers, cousins, nephews, or 'strangers in blood' ; that the heir of a 
husband or wife, pre-deceased without issue, is always the surviving wife 
or husband ; and that the heirs of the latter are brothers, cousins, 
nephews, or 'strangers in blood'. 

Then, taking into account the experience in Italy from 1872 to 1905, as to the 
frequency among deaths of unmarried as compared with married, and the experience 
of Budapest and France as to the proportion of marriages dissolved without issue, and 
assuming also the relation which the value of property left by the predeceased 
husband or wife to the surviving partner bears to the value of the property that the 
latter leaves to the children, assumed as 1 to 10, he deduces for the mean interval 
between deaths of parents and the deaths of their children, i,^, and the proper devolu- 
tion interval, id, a difference of 8 years, the latter being the smaller, i.e. : â€” 

^yf^ = 34 years ; but id = 26 years only. 

This does not piirport to be an exact or definite relationship between the two methods 
of estimating the devolution-interval, but is taken merely as shewing unquestionably 
that " the devolution-interval is appreciably smaller than the mean interval between 
the deaths of parents and the deaths of their children. Celibacy, the failure of issue 
in many marriages, and inheritance between husbands and wives, which result in the 
succession of persons of a more advanced age, explain the difference between these 
two intervals." 

Gini points out that historical data afford evidence of the trvith of this conclu- 
sion, and that in every dynasty of sufficient duration it is found that the average 
length of a reign is less than the average interval between the death of a king and 
the death of an ascendant who preceded him. He gives four examples, to which we 
here add two others, viz., the experience in the Houses of Hapsburg and Hohen- 
zoUern. It may be remarked that, since among monarchs bachelordom is quite 
exceptional, the difference is due exclusively to the absence or predecease of sons. 
In the table below the four first results are those given by Gini : â€”

74 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

Gini argues that a better approximation of the values of i^ and id can be ob- 
tained whenever figures are available shewing the degree of relationship of heirs to 
whom portions of the properties are left, and he gives instances from Italian and 
French statistics. 

In Italy a distinction is made between 8 categories, viz. : â€” 

OroupA. (a) Ascendants and descendants (exclusive of adopted children;; 
(6) uncles and nephews ; (c) great uncles and great nephews. 

Group B. [d) Husbands and wives ; (e) brothers and sisters ; (/) other relatives 
up to the sixth degree ; (gr) relatives beyond the sixth degree, " strangers 
in blood," and institutions other than benevolent or mutual aid. 

There is another category, viz., {h) benevolent and mutual aid institutions. On 
distributing successions of very small amounts (less than 100 francs) between the 
two groups, Gini obtained for the five financial years 1903-4 to 1907-8, for property 
left less succession duties, the following result, expressed in francs : â€” 

Group A, 3,434,301,000 = 78.1% ; Group B, 961,855,000 = 21.9%. 

For group A, the interval of devolution corresponds to the interval ^,â€ž between the 
death of parents and the death of surviving children, there being compensating 
features ; and the interval of devolution for group B, denoted by k, by Gini, is much 
shorter. He found the value for the former to be 34 years, and for the latter 17. 
Hence the weighted mean is 30.28 years, i.e., 34 is multiplied by 0.781 plus 17 by 
0.219. 

Gini classified " donations," which here would be known presumably as "settle- 
ments," and for the combined figures in francs for the six financial years 1900-1 to 
1905-6 he obtained : â€” 

Group A, 4,675,910,000 = 80.4% ; Group B, 1,139,099,000 = 19.6%. 

With the values 34 and 17 aa in the preceding case, these weights give 30.67 years. 
Gini concluded that these two values, viz., 30.28 and 30.67, are probably somewhat 
iinder the mark, and he supposed therefore that the true devolution interval is 
about 31 years, betraying incidentally the imprecision of the result. 

In France there are no less than 14 categories, which can be grouped in a similar 
manner, with the result that in groups A and B, the values in francs of the net pro- 
perty, viz., property left, less succession duties, are as follow : â€” 

Grovip A, 3,526,179,000 = 77.5% ; Group B, 1,024,059,000 = 22.5%. 

Weighting the values 34 and 17 accordingly, he obtained 30.17 years as the true 
devolution interval, which does not differ very greatly from the preceding result. 
His conclusion was that the hypothesis that the interval of devolution corresponds 
to the interval between the death of parents and the death of children sm-viving 
them, does not hold good in reality; in faÂ«t, that the interval of devolution is shorter 
by about three or four years [op. cit., p. 67). 

Gini recognises that for males and females, the interval of devolution is con- 
spicuously different, the former generally leaving much larger properties than the 
latter, while the mean duration of life of females is greater than that of males. He 
then shews algebraically that, if the mean interval between the deaths of parents and 
children is calculated without taking these facts into account, the figiu-e is too low 
for computing private wealth ; vide his work, pp. 67-68. He remarks that in Italy 
the proportion of properties left by males compared with that left by females is 
about 2 to 1, but in German and Anglo-Saxon countries is much higher, being in 
Victoria (1908) about 5 to 1 ; in Massachusetts (1898-91) about 3 to 1, and even 
aa high as 14 to 1 in 1829-31. 



The Interval of Devolution. 75 

It has also been recognised by him that it is necessary to take account of the 
conaequencp of the age of marriage in persons of various social classes ; richer males, 
for example, marrying later than poor males ; and for this figures are given for Den- 
mark by Rubin and Westergaard, for England by the Registrar-General (49th 
Report), for the nobility of Sweden and Finland by Fahlbeck,for Italy in the Movi- 
mento della popolazione secondo gli atti dello stalo civile, 1896 and later, for Austria 
in the population returns of 1895, and the following years. In regard to brides, there 
appears to be no regularity, the age being almost the same for all social classes in 
Denmark ; in England brides of the better classes are older ; while in Sweden and 
Finland brides of the nobility are younger than those of the population as a whole. 
The general conclusion may be drawn, however, that the moan age of persons of 
both sexes marrying is generally higher for the richer section of the population in the 
countries referred to. Consequently, if each case be weighted proportionately to 
the value of the property, a higher figure would be obtained than that arrived at by a 
simple arithmetic mean. In pointing this out Gini adds that, though the circum- 
stances indicated have the effect of thus making the exact figiire for the interval of 
devolution greater, other circumstances have a contrary effect. He remarks that 
rich persons have less children, and ordinarily these follow one another at longer 
intervals. He infers that oia the whole it is probable that the interval 
between marriage and the birth of the middle child is greater for the poor than for 
the rich; vide p. 70. The influence of fecundity on the interval he points out can be 
concluded from available data ; thus, in Paris, where the fecundity is low, it is 5 
years ; in New South Wales, Australia, 7.6 years. Further, celibacy is more frequent 
among the rich than anaong the poor, as also is childlessness of parents ; hence 
collateral successions are more frequent, the effect being, as he has shewn, that the 
interval of devolution is sensibly shorter than for direct successions. 

Henry and Lavergne(seebibliographj') point out another circumstance which has 
the effect of making the weighted mean of the intervals of devolution smaller than 
the simple mean. They observe that it may be admitted that, in the average number 
of cases {i.e., in Continental Europe), the property of the married person dying first 
is equal to the property of the svirviving partner. But a portion of the property of 
the partner dying first goes to the surviving partner. On that accoimt the second 
inheritance which the children make from their parents, and which they will enjoy 
for a shorter time, will be greater than the fii'st inheritance. Using B to denote the 
proportion of the property left by the partner first dying to the sm-viving partner, 
Gini derives the first of the two formulae shewn below as a fii'st approximation. But 
since in Italy in recent years the proportion of married males to married females 
dying waa found to be as 4 to 3, owing to the fact that husbands predecease their 
wives more frequently than survive them, it waa necessary to take this into account, 
and also the fact that (at least in Italy) the property of the husband in relation to 
that of the wife is about 2 to 1. Having regard to these circumstances Gini deduced 
the second formula ; and taking the values for i,â€ž = 34, k = 17, and ^ = ^j^ ^^' 
tained from the first formula 32.52, and fi-om the second 32.84; vide op. cit., p. 71. 

The formulae referred to are : â€” 

{2).. id .corrected, = 2 i,â€ž/ (2-f g), to a 1st, and = ( - ^â– Â»(+'^ ) /(â€” + ^ 

to a 2nd approximation. This is of course valitl 0!ily for Italy and countries 
aimilarly circumstanced. 



76 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

Other circiunstances which exercise a different influence in different nations are 
(a) the average age of persons marrying ; (b) fecundity ; (c) prevalence of cehbacy ; 
(d) the infertihty of marriages ; (e) the relative frequency of succession by husbands 
and wives, and by collateral relations. Gini remarks that in Italy these circiunstances 
caused variations even from province to province. He adds that "on the other hand 
no influence is exercised on the calculation of the interval of devolution by the fact 
that the testators leave larger amounts of property when they are more advanced in 
age," and he mentions that Mallet and Beneduce regard this fact as important. 
It may be remarked, e?i passant, that this can hardly be correct, and will be referred 
to later. According to Gini it is not a question of the mean age of testators, but 
only of the interval between their death and that of their heirs. These are reasons 
for the statement that the interval between the death of a testator and that cf his 
heir is different when the testator is older and therefore, on the average, richer, than 
when he is younger, and consequently on the average poorer. But the interval 
is greater in the second case and not in the first. 

If a testator has more than average time to augment his hereditary property, 
this augmentation may be due to two causes, either (a) because he dies at a greater 
age than the average, and then it has to be assumed that his heir will have less than 
the average time to augment the inheritance left to him ; or (6) because the person 
from whom the testator himseK inherited died younger than at the average age, in 
which case the capital he inherited mvist have been less than the average. It there- 
fore seems clear, he adds, that â€” if the interval of devolution be not on the average 
different for categories of the population more or less rich â€” the fact that testators 
dying at an advanced age leave more property in individvial cases can have no 
influence. As previously indicated, the validity of this view is questionable, and to 
this point we shall retui'n. 

Gini's svrmming up in regard to methods of evaluating the devolution-interval is 
as follows : â€” 

(i.) The various methods used for calculating the interval between the birth of 
parents and the births of children give different results, which are al- 
ways approximate, but may be either in excess or in defect. 

(ii.) The taking of the mean interval between the birth of parents and the births 
of children as equivalent to the interval of devolution is based on sup- 
positions which are not supported by facts. 

(iii.) It is necessary, first of all, to make use, not of a simple arithmetic mean, 
but of a weighted arithmetic mean, which takes cognisance of the fact 
that the interval of devolution is different for categories of persons with 
more or with less property. 

(iv.) Regard must be had to the fact that the interval between the birth of 
parents and the births of children does not, on account of many cir- 
cumstances, correspond to the interval between the death of parents 
and the death of their surviving children. 

(v.) It would certainly be desirable, but is not generally possible, to take all 
these circimnstances into account. But it is possible and necessary to 
have regard to one most important circvmistance, viz., that the interval 
between the death of parents and thedeath of their children is apj^reciably 
longer than the interval between the death of testators and the death of 
their heirs. This circumstance is due to the fact that the interval in 
the case of successions by strangera in blood, by collateral relatives, 
and by husbands or wives, is shorter than in the case of direct succession. 



The Interval of Devolution. 



77 



(vi.) It should therefore be remembered that if this circumstance is not taken 
into account, the calculated interval of devolution is about 3 or 4 years 
too high. The figures for the interval of devolution, now put at about 
33 to 34 years, should, therefore, be lowered to, say, 29 to 31 years {op. 
cit., pp. 72-73). 

Illustrating by a detailed example for Italy in 1905, Gini calc\ilatea the mean age 
of bridegrooms at 29.10, and of brides at 25.13 years, and gives the following 
results for the years 1902-1906, which shew a small but definite change : â€” 



â€”

29.07 years

By weighting the corresponding figures for Italian provinces (1905) by the ratio 
of the inheritances in every province to the inheritances in the whole kingdom, he 
obtains the result for bridegrooms =29.07, and for brides =24.91 years. All these 
figures are approximately 29 and 25 years. 

In Italy the mean interval between the date of marriage and the mean date of 
birth of all children can be taken as aboixt 8 years. The mean age of fathers at the 
mean date of the births of their children in Italy is probably not far from 34 years, and 
of mothers from 30 years. These fig\ires agree fairly with those found by Raseri for 
Udine, viz., fathers = 34, and mothers = 30.5, and for Rome, viz., fathers = 36.5, and 
mothers = 29.6. Basing his conclusion on these various sets of figures, Gini takes 
the mean interval between the birth of fathers and children as 35 years, and between 
the birth of mothers and children as 31 years. Owing to the increase in the duration 
of adult life, however (presumably for 1882 to 1901 ; vide op. cit., p. 76) he cal- 
culates from this the interval between the death of parents and children for fathers 
= 36.17 years, and for mothers =32.17 years. These intervals, bethinks, correspond 
to the devolution-interval in 78-80% of all cases of inheritance, while in the balance 
of cases it is not more than 17 years. Taking 80%, this gives the devolution-interval 
from fathers to sons =32.34 years, and from mothers to daughters = 29.14 years. 
For adult ages, the difference in the dvrration of life for males and females is about 
6 months. Assuming, it would seem somewhat at hazard, that propertj- inherited 
by males is to pi-operty inherited by females as 3 to 2, and that property left by males 
is to property left by females as 2 to l,he deduces the devolution -interval id for Italy 
as 31.8 years ; and by a similar calculation, that for France as 29.4 years. Mallet, he 
points out, and as mentioned before herein, end eavoiu-ed to determine the devolution- 
interval by means of the figures shewing the expectation of life of heirs from 272 
cases in which all particulars were known ; and used the English Life Tables, 1891- 
1900 ^. He fovind the simple means (that is, weighted merely according to niunbers) 
of the expectation of life i\n = 24, and the weighted mean (that is, weighted by the 
aggregate amoiuit or product of the numbers and amount per individual) i â€ž, 
=r 26.9 years. 

Arguing from the pecvdiaritios in English inheritances (more frequent trans- 
mission of real than of personal property to lineal descendants, no transmissions of 
real property to widows, etc.), Mallet thought the devolution-interval sho\ild be taken 
as about 24 years {loc. cit.), but Gini justly points out, and it is recognised by Mallet, 



1. See JoTir. Boy. Stat. Soc, Ixxi., pp. 80-83, 1908. 



78 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

that 272 cases are too limited a basis ; further, that the mean expectation of life may 
possibly be greater for those possessing property than for others ; and again, that 
amongst those possessing property it possibly increases with the amount of property. 
If this were so. Life Tables would be required giving the expectation of life at single 
ages for possessors of property only, and the figures would have to be weighted 
according to the amount of property : this cannot at present be done. 

Harper proposed to use the British Insurance Offices' Life Table O'^^, and by 
that means found i"^ â€” 27.4 years. This appears to Gini to be too low, partly 
because the greater expectation of life of females is disregarded, and partly because 
the mean expectation of life of heirs was not weighted in proportion to the projDerty 
inherited. 

Gini himaelf proposes the use of the difference between the mean age of testators 
and the mean age of heirs, and to weight the ages proportionately to the property 
involved, and he arrives at the following conclusions : â€” 

" The devolution-interval is given by the difference between the weighted mean 
age at which persons inherit, and the weighted mean age at which they transmit the 
inherited property ; where the ages of the various persons are weighted proportion- 
ately to the amount of the inheritance." Aa, however, it is not possible to follow 
up individual persona from the moment when they inherit to the moment when they, 
in their turn, transmit their inheritance, this has to be modified as follows : â€” 

" The devolution-interval can be determined, as a first approximation, by meana 
of the difference between the weighted average age of heirs and the weighted average 
age of testatoi-3 of the same year." 

This, denoted by i'd, will be the exact devolution-interval only if the mean 
duration of life of proprietors remain constant. Since, however, this continues to 
increase, a second approximation should be made, when the weighted ages of both 
testators and heirs have been determined for a long series of years, together with the 
respective values of i'd- Then we are able to state that " the devolution-interval 
can be determined from the difference between the weighted average age of the 
testators of a given year and the weighted average age of heirs at id j^ears before." 

Mallet's calculations, he asserts, fm-nish the data for this. They give the 
simple and weighted averages of ages of heirs = 45.2 and 41.0 years respectively. 
From the same figures Gini computes the ages of testators for the two years 1905 and 
1906, and found the simple and weighted averages of ages of testators = 64.4 and 
69.7 years respectively. This gives the mean devolution-interval = 69.7 â€” 41 = 
28.7 years. 

Gini maintains, however, that this is too small, because the mean dui-ation of 
life of proprietors increases with the time. On the other hand it must not be for- 
gotten tliat the average age of heirs was calculated on a very small number, and that 
the average age of testators refers to possessors of at least Â£100. 

For Victoria, Australia, in 1908, the simple and weighted averages of the ages of 
testators was found by Gini to bo respectively : â€” 



Males. Females. 



Persons. 



64 1 and 72.2 years. 64.1 and 68.2 years. 



64.1 and 71.5 years. 



The Interval of Devolution. 79 

For France, in 1900, the simple average age of testators was 61 years 7 months. 
The use made of this figure in subsequent calculations (by which March found the 
devolution-interval = 29 years 5 months^ is pointed out by Gini to have been liased 
upon several erroneous assumptions, viz., that the heirs were supposed to be dis- 
tributed in ages as the people living, and that the simple mean was satisfactory. 
March, having found the mean age of the living at the 1901 Census to bo 31 years 2 
months, deducted it from the simple mean of the ages of the testators 61 years 7 
months, the difference 29 years 5 months being assumed to represent the mean 
devolution-interval. The computation Gini points out is, however, unsatisfactory, 
because on the one hand the heirs are distributed in respect of age quite differently to 
the living, and on the other hand because the calculation of the average age from the 
simple instead of the weighted mean leads to sensible error. It is, however, to March 
that credit is due for having first thought of derivins: the devolution-interval from 
the difference between the mean age of testators and the mean age of heirs. 

In closing this apercu of Professor Gini's criticism of the devolution -interval 
method, it may be remarked that he recognises the grave limitations to which it is 
subject, and on this matter we shall offer later some further observations. It is 
quite clear that the devolution-interval is dift'erent as between country and country, 
and the data necessary for its proper computation are at least as elaborate as the 
data necessary for computing by another and more direct method. Before proceeding 
with a discussion of tliis, it will not be inappropriate to give Gini's general con- 
clusions in respect of variotis methods of computing private wealth. These are as 
follow : â€” 

(a) All methods have both advantages and disadvantages. 

(6) It is impossible to assert that one is theoretically superior to another ; 
but it must, on the contrary, be held that according to the statistical 
data available for a covmtry, so is one or the other method the better. 

(c) Though the method of the devolution-interval seemed, for a long time, 

to be the safest, new elements of uncertainty are continually being 
discovered in it ; its application in Italy was, however, justified in the 
past, inasmuch as the necessary data for the other methods were lacking. 

(d) The method of the capitalisation of incomes may perhaps give fair results 

for the United Kingdom, but cannot be based on any secure foundation 
in other countries. 

(e) In Sweden, Himgarj- and France the Inventory-method may perhaps lead 

to the best results. 

{J) A plausible application of any other method to all forms of wealth can 
hardly be conceived. But that does not imply that in the valuation of 
the different categories of wealth it is necessaiy always to use the same 
method. [The author appears to ignore the essential conceptual 
difference between the rate-of-devolution method and the interval-of- 
devolution method.] 

{g) Further, if in the case of any countrj-, one method appears preferable to 
the others, the latter may still offer useful elements for the purposes of 
independent estimate or checking. 

(h) There are methods, such as that of the proportion between existing and 
hereditary property, which, although they may not lead to a satisfactory 
evaluation of the wealth of any given country, may serve in a comparison 
of the wealth of dift'erent countries, so far as the uncertainty and tlie 
inexactitude of the evaluations in various countries depend upon imiform 
circumstances. 



80 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

(i.) Finally, it appears that hitherto the statisticians have been often too 
exclusive in the choice of their methods, and consequently the maxim to 
be observed by anyone who undertakes the calculation of wealth is : â€” 
" The best method consists in taking advantage of all methods" 
{op. ciL, pp. 140-141). 

.3. The defect of the devolution-interval method. â€” The preceding discussion by 
Gini of the devolution-interval method exposes the complexity of its assumptions, 
and reveals something of its inherent uncertainty. The fact that it depends upon so 
many changing factors, the precise estimation of which is not unattended with 
difficulty, and the appropriate corrections for which moreover are uncertain, and the 
further fact that its pitfalls are not obvious, indicate that it should be abandoned 
if any method, the intrinsic character of which is more obvious, can be employed. 
It will be seen later that there are elements also which it does not embrace. 

Professor Gini's very able discussion of the proper computation of the devolu- 
tion-interval shews conclusively that factors must be apj^hed which take account, 
not only of the magnitude of successions and of settlements, but also of sex differ- 
ences in regard thereto, and of the variation of these with time. 

Let us fix our attention upon the question of the devolution-interval in regard 
to the persons (with the requisite wealth) living at say the present moment. An 
infinitesimal group at age x will live on the average say e^. years, e^. being the expecta- 
tion of life for the age x ; in other words, this period will be the crude devolution- 
interval for all persons of age x. We will, however, be in error if we assvime that the 
(I/e3.)th part will pass in one year. In order to find the true amount it will be 
necessary to take into account the manner in which e^ is ascertained, because the 
number of persons of any age x does not decrease with the lapse of time in a linear 
manner. When account is taken of the non-linear character of the decrease it is 
immediately evident that ive are concerned, not unth the expectation of life or devobition- 
interval, but with the devolution -rate or instantaneous rate of mortality ; and the average 
of this taken over one year will be the rate of mortality for the middle of the year. 
It is, of course, true that there are analytical relations between the " expectation of 
life" at various ages and the rate of mortality at various ages, l)ut if we posses the 
latter we need not concern ourselves in regard to the former in order to ascertain 
with what rapidity the wealth of the community will pass to successors. In fact, 
the necessity of ascertaining the devolution-interval was for no other purpose than 
this. From this point of view it is at once seen that the attempt to introduce the general 
devolution-interval iyito the question is a useless complication, not merely because it 
needs so many correcting modifications, but also because the fundamental idea that 
this interval is required, or is the appropriate quantily to use, is really invalid. In short, 
the crude basis of the idea, viz., that if the existing wealth in anj' generation passes 
in the interval i to another generation, the ith part passes in one year is not correct. 
The rapidity of passing is measured by the deatli-rato itself, and in order to measure 
the rate of devolution of estates it merely requires that the frequency of deaths in 
various age-groups â€” and, since the amount per individual passing at death varies 
with age, the relative importance of each age-group in respect of wealth â€” should 
be known. 

Thus the idea of the " devolution-interval" should be abandoned and in its 
place the idea of the " rate of devolution," should be adopted, computing this 
latter by means of the death-rates at different ages, weighted according to the average 
amount of wealth possessed at these ages. For this purpose only statistics of the rate 
of mortality for different ages and of the ages of persona dying and of the size of 



The Rate of Devolution. 81 

their estates is needed. It will be seen that the mere statement cf this method 
indicates at once its superiority over the method of ascertaining the devolution- 
interval. In principle it is direct and, so far aa it goes, exact. Unfortunately, however, 
the conception put forward, though lacking nothing in accuracy as regards principle, 
is inadequate in regard to the proper definition of aU the relevant circumstances. 
This will appear as we proceed, and we shall endeavour to exhibit its limitations 
as well as tc illustrate its technique. We shall call the method which we now 
proceed to examine the " Devolution-Rate Method" in contra-distincticn to the 
" Devolution -Interval Method." To what has been said, it may be added that the 
rate-of -devolution method might quite appropriately Ije called the rigorous "parcel 
method," because the fundamental conception is that the incidence of death is 
indiscriminate, and therefore those dying in each age-group are, with some 
limitations, a representative sample of the entire group. 



CHAPTER n.â€” THE RATE OF DEVOLUTION. 



1. The devolution-rate method. â€” In his contribution to the discussion of Messrs, 
Harris and Lake's paper on "' Estimates of the Realisable Wealth of the United 
Kingdom based mostly on the Estate Duty Returns," ^ Sir T. A. (then Mr.) Coghlan 
made an important suggestion that the " only true way of ascertaining the wealth of 
those alive from the an:iovmt of those who had died during a given period, was to 
take into consideration the ages of persons both living and dying" (p. 736). He 
advised the formation of age-groups, the finding of " the average wealth possessed 
by the persons in each category" (i.e., age-group), and then by " multiplying the 
amount so ascertained by the numbers then living belonging to each category" 
(group), " they would arrive at the total wealth of the community" (ibid). This 
suggestion was applied by Mr. Bernard Mallet in his paper of 18th February, 1908 
(Jom-n. Roy. Stat. Soc, Ixxi., pp. (55-84, 1908), and he deduced values for England 
for 1905 and 1906 by this method (loc. cit., p. 74). The statement of the method aa 
it appears above needs some qualification, which will be discussed in due course. 

The principle of the devolution-rate method more rigorously stated is as follows : 

(i.) Assimiing that at each age those dj-ing fairly represent, in respect of 
wealth possessed, the living at the same age, the ratio at that age of 
the living to the dying is the factor to be multiplied into the aggregate, 
wealth possessed by the dying in order to express the wealth of the 
living. 

(ii.) Since experience has shewn that the mortality-rate at any age differs 
as between males and females, and that the average wealth possessed 
also differs, the wealth possessed by the sexes should be estimated 
separately in order to secure precision in the results. 



1. .Idiirii. Hoy. Stat. Soc. Ixix., pp. 709-732. 



82 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

(iii.) If the incidence of death varies as between different classes of either sex 
at any age, a like observation to (ii.) applies, mutatis mutandis. 

(iv.) The effect of all circumstances tending to produce a systematic difference 
in the average wealth possessed at any age as between the living and 
dying at that age must be evalued and allowed for, in order to secure 
correct results. 

In regard to the last, it will be seen hereinafter that there are such diiferences,. 
and therefore Coghlan's principle and Mallet's application of it need some amend- 
ment. The devolution-rate method has virtually been used by Laughton * and 
by Gini in the work previously mentioned. 



2. Discussion and technique of the devolution-rate method.^ â€” Sufficient has 
already been said to indicate clearly in what sense the method can be conceived as 
being founded upon the devolution-rate. In formulating the statement of its 
technique the notion of the method as a " parcel-method" will be kept mainly in 
view, though wc shall use either conception indifferently, since they both are appro- 
priate, and both points of view have value. In some cases it may be easier to grasp 
the significance of the facts from the one or from the other point of view. The whole 
matter, however, will appear more definite if it be borne in mind that, subject to 
certain limitations, the dying are to be taken as a sample of the living in regard to the 
wealth coming into evidence in the " successions." The limitations referred to, 
however, are important, for it will be found that there are reasons for believing that 
the living must be regarded as in some respects differently characterised in regard to 
wealth from the dying ; and it is also to be borne in mind that the rigoiu- of the 
" pai'cel" assumption increases as the age-group diminishes, since the death-rate 
varies conspicuovisly from age to age. We proceed to consider the teclmique of 
the method. 

Probate returns reveal the fact that D persons dying in any age-group were, in 
the aggregate, possessed of the amount of M'ealth xv, say. If they be regarded as a 
fair sample of the group, then the aggregate of wealth, W, in the same age-group, 
will be the ratio of the living to the dying {L/D = R say) multiplied into the wealth 
possessed by the D persons, i.e. : â€” 

(3) W= ivL/D = wR = iv/r. 

in which r, the reciprocal of R, is the death-rate. 

It has been suggested, however, that the general rate of mortality of the age- 
group does not accurately represent the class whose wealth comes under review in 
probate returns, forasmuch as it has been supposed that the death-rate for that class 
will be less, for example, than that for all classes combined. Thus Mr. A. M. 
Laughton, the Government Statist of the State of Victoria, expresses the opinion that 
" it is probable that the rate of mortality among persons having property is below 
that prevailing in the general community ; and that it will approximate to the rate 
among assured lives." ^ It may be added that probably each country has its special 
characteristics as regards this. If the view expressed be just, then the multiplier 
R will not be strictly correct. This is a point which must hereinafter necessarily 
be fully considered.

3. The error of treating the entire population as a single age-group. â€” The most 
elementarj- application of the preceding formula would be to treat the entire popula- 
tion as forming a single age-group, that is, to assume that the living and dying are 
similarly constituted as regards wealth. In this case the aggregate of wealth, \V,

We shall see later that this assumption leads to a result very much in excess of 
the truth, if applied to the entire population. For in the State of \'ictoria for the 
years 1908 to 1912 inclusive, we obtain the following results, I. to IV., according as 
they are calculated for males and females together or separately. 

In the Table hereunder (I.) shews the result obtained by computing with the 
total population as a single age-group ; (II.) shews that obtained by computing with 
all males as a single age-group ; (III.) is based on a computation with all females 
as a single age-group ; and (IV.) giv^es the result obtained by combining com- 
putations (II.) and (III.).

84 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

It will be seen from these results that, when males and females are treated 
separately, the sum of the two is uniformly less (on the average about 5h per cent.) 
than when the population is treated without distinction of sex. This is due to the 
great disparity between the amounts contributed by females and males. From 
what is shewn later it will be seen further that correction factors are necessary ; these 
are shewn in the table and indicate the magnitude of the error in the assumption that 
the results for all ages can be treated as a single group as has often been done ; it will also 
be observed that these correcting factors are different from j^ear to year. The 
correction-factor for "persons," for the average of the 1908-1912 results, is 0.3822. 

Here it may be observed that any popvilation consists roughlj- of equal nvunbers of 
the sexes, but the data shew that not only have females on the average much less 
wealth than males, but also there are fewer possessing wealth ; hence result 
(1), see table, based on the number of persons, will in general be of less accuracy than 
that based upon a consideration of the data for the sexes treated separatelJ^ An 
analogous observation applies to the age-groups among either sex. It is due to this 
latter that the large correction factor is required, and to this we shall now refer. 

The correction-factor for the average of the 1908-1912 results for " males " is 
no less than 0.3908 ; and the correction-factor for " females," on the same basis, 
no less than 0.4471. (The way in which these correction-factors are deduced is 
explained hereinafter.) It is fairly evident from these examples that the method, 
even with the use of the deduced correction -factors, cannot be expected to yield 
results of high acciuracy, since the correction-factors vary greatly from year to year. 

Assuming that the persons of each age dying are characterised, in respect of 
wealth possessed, similarly to those living of the same age, then it follows that for the 
dying to correctly represent the living, it is essential either that the numbers dying in 
each age-group must be proportional to the numbers living in the same groups ; that 
is to say, the death-rate must be the same for all ages, or that by some complex 
relation the wealth-ratio will be fortuitously identical. The latter supposition is 
obviously excluded as a general possibility ; and above .5 years of age the death-rate 
is small where the numbers of the popiilation are relatively large, and large (for the 
older ages) where the numbers of the population are relatively small. Hence, 
a priori, it is obvious that the whole range of life cannot be treated as a single age- 
group. To do so cannot yield an accurate result, or one even approximately correct. 
We have already seen that it does not do so, for the correcting factor, instead of 
being nearly unity, was only about 0.4. 



4. The error of estimations of wealth by attributing it to a single age-group of 
21 years and upward.^ â€” The characteristic defect in the assumption that the popula- 
tion may be treated as a single age-group will apply to any large age-group, but will 
be less seriovis if we exclude the ages, viz., the earlier ages of life, which, while they 
contribute little or nothing to the probate-returns, exhibit considerable fluctuations 
in their death-rates. 

It has sometimes been assumed, in estimating wealth from probate-returns, 
that it would be sufficiently accurate to regard adult lives as constituting a homo- 
geneous group, and consequently that it would be satisfactory to suppose that the 
whole of the wealth disclosed in such retiuTis coiild be divided by the total number of 
adults dying in order to obtain the average per individual. This, it was thovight, 
could be regarded aa the average wealth per head of all adults ; hence, by multiply- 



The Rate of Devolution. 85 

ing this average by the total number of adults living, the aggregate private wealth 
would be ascertained, subject of course to some correction for tlie fact that there is no 
necessity to make probate returns for less than a certain amount. This very erroneous 
method has even been usetl in official statistics. 

The method approximates, however, somewhat more closely to the truth than 
the previous assumption imder which the entire population was treated as a single 
age-group, and was used in Victoria for estimating tlie average net value of estates for 
1898-1902. The amount per head of deceased adults was computed, and this 
amount, multiplied by the nmnber of adults at the middle of the period (or rather 
those disclosed at the Census of 1901) was regarded as indicating the total private 
wealth. It will be seen later that the error of this assvunption is considerable, and 
that the method should not be followed. As already indicated, it virtually treats 
the entire population (of both sexes) of 21 years of age and upward as a homogeneous 
age-group, and attributes the net wealth disclosed in the probate returns to the 
adults dying. It therefore supposes that they may be taken to fairly represent the 
adults living, and that no serious error will be made in supjaosing that the whole 
wealth of the commiuiity belongs to the adults. 

In this method the value of R in formula (4) will be the reciprocal of the death- 
rate for all ages from the beginning of 21 iipwards, and the magnitude of its errors is 
fvilly illustrated in the tables hereunder, that is to say, the result so deduced must be 
multiplied by the correcting factor indicated in the table to give the proper result. 
This factor would be, of coiuse, unity if the method were correct, consequently its 
reciprocal shews the magnitude of the error arising from neglecting it.

It is seen from this that the factor of correction has increased, but it is still only 
about 0.5 ; that is to say, this method gives results uhich are about double their true 
value. 



5. Determination of factors for correcting large group-results. â€” It has already 
been indicated that if the population be taken either as a whole, or as adults of 21 
years of age and upwards, we obtain, aa the average result of Victorian probate returns 
for 1908-1912, an indication that the following corrections are required : â€”

As the method followed increases in precision, the correction-factor approaches 
unity, hence it is evident that there is no material advantage in considering "adults" 
as a homogeneous age-group, as compared with the assumption that the entire 
population can be so regarded ; and this is so even if the sexes be separately con- 
sidered. 

It has not yet been indicated in what way the corrections have been deduced. 
It will suffice, however, to note that the validity of the assumption of homogeneity 
increases as the age-group taken diminishes (supposing, of course, the numbers to be 
sufficiently great) ; and since the sexes are very differently characterised as regards 
wealth, it is necessary to treat them separately. Hence formula (3), viz., W â€” Rw, 
flhould be applied to small age-groups only, and their sums taken. (The sexes 
should also, of course, be treated separately). It is established later that 10-year 
groups require a correction factor of sensibly unity (0.98 to 0.99), and single year 
groups practically no correction at all (0.9997). 

The details will appear later. It will suffice here to observe that a theoretically 
ideal method supposes that the continuous variation of both R and tv is determined 
according to age, and that the methods of the infinitesimal calculus are employed, 
see formula (21) hereinafter. 

6. Determination of the multipliers, independent of, and dependent upon the 
death-rate, for deducing the total wealth from the wealth disclosed in probate. â€” For 

rough computations, and on the assumption that the relative amount of wealth 
according to age and the death-rate according to age remain constant, a factor may 
be readily determined which, multiplied into the total wealth disclosed, will give the 
aggregate for the same class in the population (living) of the same age. Further, if 
it be supposed that any increase or diminution of death-rate affects the death-rate 
at all ages similarly, a factor may be computed which will take account of the 
changing death-rate and permit of the introduction in the formula of the reciprocals 
of the death-rate for any particular j^ear. These factors are denoted respectively 
by the letters h and a, the approximate values being accented, and the exact values, 
computed on infinitesimal methods, being unaccented. We proceed to the detailed 
consideration of the matter. The fundamental assumption is that, in each age- 
group, the ratio of those persons dying whose estates come under review for probate, 
to the total number in the group actually dying, is the ratio d/D (or deceased 
persons possessing estates to total dying), and that this holds for the living. It 
must also be assumed that the average value of the estates for such age-group is 
the same for the living as for the dying. On these assimiptions we may deduce 
the required factors, viz., those which, multiplied into the total wealth disclosed by 
probate, will give the aggregate of estates similarly liable to come under review for 
probate. 



The Rate of Devolution. 87 

Let this factor be denoted by k' ; then obviously, by mere definition : â€” 
(5) k' {w^ + 10,^ + etc.) = W^ + Wg + etc, = W, say, 

the total wealth, the suffixes denoting here the successive age-groups. But since it 
is assumed that the distribution of wealth among the living is the same as among the 
dying, it follows that, for each age-group, W = Pw/D = Rw ; that is, the recipro- 
cal of the death-rate for the age-group multiplied by the wealth revealed in the 
probates for the group. Hence, substituting this for W, and dividing both sides of 
the equation by if , + ^w., + ^tc. = Hw, we obtain 

(6) it' = 'E,{R . w/Sw); 

each suffix for R being the same as that for the corresponding w throughovit. That 
is to say k' is the weighted value of the R's, the weights being the relative dis- 
tribution according to age of the wealth disclosed by probate. 

From the last formula it is at once evident that the factor k' depends merely 
upon the product of the relative distribution of wealth according to age into the 
reciprocal of the death-rate according to age ; that is, it is affected by changes both 
in the distribiition of wealth according to age, and in the mortality according to 
age. 

The result is important, for it exposes definitely the invalidity of the attempts to 
deduce this factor merely from the duration of a generation, from the general death- 
rate, or the expectation of life at age 0, or by any similar process ; in short, it shews 
that what is known as the devolution-interval method, which we have already con- 
sidered at length, is an invaUd method, 

There is, of com'se, as already implied, no necessary relation between the factor 
k' and the general death-rate for either sex (or for " persons") of the ages diu'ing 
which it is found through probate that wealth appears in evidence (or if we please, 
the death-rate for all ages), a point to which reference will be made later. Let, 
however, a' be a factor which, multiplied into Rq, the reciprocal of this death-rate,* 
will give k' ; that is : let â€” 

(7) a'Ro = k' ; so that a'i?o ('<^i + Wg "^ Â®**'") ~ ^ 

then of course â€” 

(8) a' = k'/Ro = lliRto) / {Ro .'^w) 

By applying this formula it can be discovered whether a ' is fairly constant. More 
accurate results will, of course, be obtained if the factor be deduced for the sexes 
separately, the method becoming quite rigoroiis when the age-groups are infinitesimal. 

From what has preceded it is clear that it is impossible to deduce the factor 
which must be multiplied into the wealth appearing in probate retm-ns, unless at 
least two things are known, viz., 

(a) the relative amount of wealth contributed by people in the different 

age -groups ; and 

(b) the death-rates for the ditl'erent age-groups, or, as will be shewn, their 

relative ^â– alue. 

* That is, for all ages or for the range of ages appearing to be of conseaiience in probate matters. 



ss 



The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



In all probability the second of these (b) dc es not in general change very rapidly 
with lapse of time ; the former (a) changes somewhat irregularly because of the 
irregular way in which large estates come under review. To find the values of Rw/Hw 
it is, of course, necessary to have the absolute death-rates ; but if we assume that 
the death-rates in each age-group vary as the . general death-rate, then their 
mutual relation is sufficient, taken in conjunction with that general death-rate. It 
will be most convenient to work with reciprocals 1/r^ etc., of the death-rates, say 
R , R , etc., or to find the relation of these to the reciprocal of the death-rate for 
the aggregate of all groups concerned, R^ , say. That is, if the values oi p = R / R^ , 
p ^z= R / R^, etc., be found, it might be expected that they probably will not 
â€¢change greatly tor moderate intervals of time, and, given these for any epoch, 
the group-rates can be approximately determined therefrom by multiplying by the 
general death-rate or death-rate of the aggregate. Hence from (6), (7) and (8) we 
have : â€” 

(9) k' = R,)^ ipu') / Hw, and 

(10) a' = ^ipio) /2w; 

or, if u be written for w/llw, then this last expression takas the form 

(11) a' = p,u, + pjj,^ -f etc = 21 {pu) 

which is independent of the absolute values both of the death-rate and the wealth at each 
age. Then it would follow that 

(12) W = a'i?o2w = k'I,w 

that is to say, the aggregate wealth of the living (whose estates would be subject to 
probate) is the product of the wealth actually appearing in probate returns, multi- 
plied by the product of the factor a' into the reciprocal of the general death-rate 
' (or the death-rate of a large group of ages, e.g. 15 to 85). 



7. Should the general death-rate be used ? â€” Before furnishing numerical results 
for comparisons, the questions may be considered whether Rg may be taken as the 
general death-rate, or whether it should be the death-rate for the ages within the 
limits for which probate returns appear. These may be taken as from say 10 or 15 
years of age upwards. The death-rate for the ages to 9 and that for the wliole 
â– of life in the State of V^ictoria are respectively : â€”

Being thus approximately identical throughout, there would apparently be no 
striking advantage in taking /?â€ž as the recijjrocal of the death-rate for all ages from 
10 years of age to the end of life ; it will probably be always siifficient to take it as 
the reciprocal of the general death-rate. Later this point will be further discussed. 
The factor a ' may be regarded as a correcting factor to a crude result obtained by 
multiplying the total wealth by the reciprocal of the general death-rate. 



The Rate of Devolution. 



89 



To compute a value of the factor a' or of the factor k' , to be applied to " per- 
sons," it is obvious that in the former case we must take account of differences 
in the wealth contributed, and in the latter the differences both in weaUli and 
death-rates. To compute this for persons, let a 'â€žj denote the factor for males, a '/ 
for females, and a\ for persons ; 'Lio^, Hw/, and Su-^ the aggregate wealth, subject 
to probate, for males, females, and persons respectively ; and Rm, Rf, and Rp the 
reciprocals of the death-rates for males, females, and persons respectively : then 
obviously the weighted result is : â€” 



(13) a' = {a\nRm^' 



a'jRf^uy)/Rj, ^iVp 



and these formulae will, of course, though only approximate, probably be sufficiently 
accurate for practical pmposes. For strictly accurate results the values of a' and 
k' for " persons" should be determined directly, in the same manner as for males or 
for females. 

8. Estimation of the uncertainty in the values of the correction-factors.â€” It is 
obvious from what has preceded that the results deduced from single years must be 
sxibject to a considerable margin of uncertainty. The irregularity of the appearance 
of large estates in the returns necessarily involves this, and the fact is perhaps 
more strikingly seen in the values deduced for the coefficients a' and k' which, it 
will later be shewn, are sufficiently accurate for the purpose in question : â€”

Since both these coefficients are independent of the absolute amount of the wealth 
revealed in probate returns, and a' is also independent of the absolute death-rate, 
it is clear that for any one year these returns can afford only a very rough indication of 
the wealth possessed by the liviin/. FiVen quinquennial rt^sults are inadequate to furnish 
anything like a very exact estimate of the margui of uncertainty. In the absence of 
anything better, however, a deduction may be drawn by applying the theory of errors. 
If then the averages be taken (shewn in table) and the probable error of a single 
value and of the average is deduced by applying the usual formulae, viz. : â€” 

/j Iw1 ] 
(15) p = i)robable error of single year =0.674 "y , _ i i' â€¢ 

/j [^] 1 
(16) po = probable error of Â» years = 0.674 \ (â€ž(,, _i) | â€¢ 

then the results are as follow, viz. : â€”

There are, no doubt, much larger " systematic " errors than these, viz., errors 
due to the tendency to make the element of estimate of value a " conservative 
one," but such errors cannot be readily determined, and their estimation is not a 
question of mathematical technique. Quite apart from this the ivealth deduced from 
the aggregate coming under review in probate in any one year is probably in error not 
les.i than 7%, even if the death-rate be taken into account, and not lesfi than 9% if 
%t be neglected ; and further, the mean of five years' results reduces these amounts 
respectively only to about 3% and 4%. Group-values for 10 years would pro- 
bably be only 2% in error in either case, and the deduced result could be regarded 
as applying to the middle of the period. 

9. Cause of uncertainty in results. â€” In order to see whether deductions of wealth 
from probate returns are entitled to much confidence, the effect both of the absolute 
amounts of the wealth in the returns, and the absolute values of the death-rates 
should be eliminated. To do this it will suffice to compute a table of values of u, 
viz., of the ratios of the wealth passing at any age to the total w^ealth passing, and 
also one of values of pu, for a series of years, for which pvirpose the Victorian data for 
the years 1908-1912 are taken (see tables hereunder). Variation in the values of 
u is, of course, caused by the irregular appearance of large estates among probate- 
returns. 

Even for a considerable population, the frequency with which very large estates 
appear in such returns will be irregular compared with that with which smaller 
estates appear. This is conspicuously shewn in any returns of the number of estates 
of different magnitude. We take an illustration from Prussian retvmis, the reason 
for obtaining which has now become manifest : â€”

It is at once obvious froni this table that the falling in of very large estates through 
death will be rare ; nevertheless, when it does occur, it will greatly prejudice the 
evaluation of the factors a and k for the year in question, since the ratio of ii = w/llw 
for some particular age-group will be greatly altered. Obviously we are not con- 
cerned with changes in the abfiolute amounts, but only in their ratio to the total, azid 
this is what is shewn in the tables hereinafter. Similar remarks apply to variations 
of death-rate, but there is no reason to lielieve that these fluctuate greatly. 

In the following table any effect due merely to variations in the absolute amount 
of wealth is eliminated as explained. The ratio of the wealth of each group to the 
total is expressed from year to year in the upper part of the table. In the lower part 
of the table is given the product of this ratio, into the ratio which the reciprocal of the 
death-rate of this group bears to the reciprocal of the general death-rate : â€”

It will at once be seen how greatly the values for any age-group differ from year 
to year. Moreover, they differ considerably as between localities. The State of- 
New South Wales is in most respects comparable to that of Victoria. Its population, 
social and economic progress, and racial characteristics are sensibly identical, and it 
might reasonably be expected that the values of u or of pii would be identical for the 
two. But that the fact is far otherwise appears from the values given in the following

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



The results shew that even for a community which may be supposed to be 
similarly circumstanced economically, an identical factor should not be assumed ; 
for u, though independent of the absolute amount of wealth, and pu both of the 
absolute death-rate and the amount of absolute wealth, vary considerably. The fact 
i=. that the proportion of persons dying who contribute to the probate returns to the 
general population of the same age-group is very variable, viz., for the reasons above 
indicated. 

These last tables reveal the fact that results from year to year materially differ 
and, since it is evident that the aggregate of wealth itself of the whole community 
does not fluctuate in this erratic way, the inference to be drawn is that, to secure 
anything like a reliable estimate, the average for a number of years should he taken, 
preferably, it is thought, ten, since that is long enougli to include the ordinary 
periods of financial vicissitudes. ^ It has already been mentioned that Gini had 
noticed the effect of change in the mean duration of life upon the devolution- 
interval. A like remark applies also to the factor R, which is to be multiplied into 
the wealth contributed by each age-group of deceased persons. A careful examina- 
tion of the evidence in the last three tables will shew an indication of progressive 
change with time. If the death-rate diminish, the factor R will increase. And here 
it may be stated that Australian mortality experience (1881-1890 and 1901-1910) 
shews the necessity of recognising that no factor can be regarded as of constant value. 
We now pass to the consideration of this point. 



10. Effect of change in the rate of mortality^ upon the computation of private 
wealth. â€” The change of the death-rate for almost every age-group in Australia is 
remarkable. This is seen 'n\ the followmg table : â€”

t These depend upon 3-years' residts, viz., 1910, 1911, 1912, and the population of 1911 only. 

t The smalhiess of these numbers is due to the heavy death-rate for the ases in question. 
The Queensland climate was apparently inimical under the conditions of early settlement, but is 
now very satisfactory. 

1. In a conmiunication made by the writer to the IMinister of Home Affairs of Australia, in February 
1910, it was stated that ten years' experience would be necessary for a reliable basis for an estimate of 
tills character. It will be seen that these results confirm that opinion. 

2. This has been considered in the -Appendix A to Vol. I. of the Report on the Census of the Com- 
monwealth of Au.stralia ; see pp. 378-389.

The values of R are based upon tlie Life Tablea prepared in connection 
with the 1911 Australian Census, and shew how very different these values 
may be for different States, those for Queensland being given Ijy way of com- 
parison with the values for the Commonwealth. They also show that the factors 
by which the amovmts revealed in probate must be multiplied vary very markedly 
with time. 

The results for the past 30 years may be very fairly represented by an

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



These resvilts, dedviced from the death-rates for the Commonwealth, are applic- 
able to the Commonwealth only on the supposition that the mean Victorian dis- 
tribution of wealth apcording to age for the period 1908-1912 apjolies, or that New 
South Wales distribution in 1911 applies, as the case may be. The close agreement 
for "persons" is merely fortuitous, and the results differ sensibly for both males and 
females owing to the very different distribution of wealth according to age. At the 
present time the necessary information does not exist for a rigorously accui'ate 
computation applicable to the whole of Australia. 

11. Arithmetical example of effect of progressive change in death-rates. â€” The 

effect of the variation in the death-rate can be made arithnietically apparent by 
adopting a known distribution and applying it to the reciprocals of these rates. For 
five-year age groups from 15-20, 20-25, etc., to 100-105, one smoothing of the resxiltg. 
for males and females gave the following proportions in ten thousands, viz. : â€” 

Males 6 27 53 83 130 279 463 616 744 890 1,124 1,462 2,086 1,392 495 123 26 1

These, multiplied by the reciprocals of the group death-rates, gave the following 
results, viz., those in the left-hand side of the table : â€”

These quantities (on the left-hand side, h' , see formula 9) are the factors â€” if the 
distribution of the total wealth in each age -group be as supposed, which, multiplied 
into the aggregate wealth appearing in any probate return, give the aggregate of the 
wealth of the living of all ages taken together. The quantities on the right-hand 
side are also factors, but must be multiplied by the reciprocal of the general death- 
rate. The quantities on the right-hand side are the values a', which, when mxilti- 
plied by the reciprocals of the death-rates (of males, females, or persons as the case 
may be). The quantities k' and a' can be used with death-rates for ages 15 to 85, 
the important period of life as far as probates are concerned, or ages 15 to 105, or 
yet again, to 105, that is to say, the ordinary crude death-rates. Inasmuch as 
these last are always the most readily available, it is preferable to adopt them.^ 
The values of bbth k ' and a ' are given in the table above for the Commonwealth 
and for Queensland, because the progression of the death-rates was so entii'ely 
different in the two cases, and this is reflected in the results, although the distribution 
of wealth is assvumed to be identical.

12. Correction to reduce group-results to results given by a continuous curve. â€” 

We have seen that if the whole laojjulation be treated as a single age-group, the error 
is 80 great that we get the correct result only after miiltiplying by about 0'4. If we 
treat the whole of the wealth as belonging to persona of 21 years of age and upwards, 
which is substantially true, the factor of correction becomes about 0'5, that is, it is 
slightly nearer unity. It is, of course, also true that even a ten-year group will not 
give a theoreticallj' faviltless result, since the smaller the group the more accurately 
will the facts be represented, inasmuch as, in their ideal form, the curves of variation 
of wealth with age, and of deatli with age, must be regarded as continuo\.;s. In tlie 
nature of the case, group-methods are, of coiu'se, only approximate, and before 
adopting them it is necessary to inquire whether the eri'or, consequent upon the 
adoption of a group of any particular size, is negligible or not. It has already been 
shewn that the error of ten-year groupings is very small in comparison with the 
uncertainty of the data, and it may be added that five-year age-groupings might well 
be regarded as rigorously exact. We shall consider first the question of the error of 
ten-year age-groupings, and shall deduce a factor of correction whicli will probably 
be sufftciently exact for ten-year groupings in other countries. 

The rigorous solution can be developed in the following form. Put 

(19) p = i2/i?o = A {x) â€¢ ''Sa; = hW/W = /, {x) hx 

yf:.{x) dx tlius being unity between the limits of age comprised, say, 10 to 105, or 
if we prefer it from age to the end of life. Then 

(20) SW = RhW = RWf, (x) 8x = /?o Wf, (x) f, [x) hx ; 

consequently 

(21) W = RoW / pudx 

the limits being the extreme ages in question. 

By graduation of the curves p and iÂ« for yearly values it was found that for 
" males," " females," and " peraons" this last expression gave correcting factors 
of about 0.9873, 0.9817, and 0.9858 respectively, instead of vmity, to be applied to the 
group-results adopted (viz., about 10 years) to reduce them to what would be given 
by 1-year groups, and further, a factor of about 0.9997 to reduce them to what wovdd 
be given by infinitesimal groups, i.e., by 0.9870, 0.9814, and 0.9855 respectively. That 
is, the group-results forepersons" should be multiplied by 0.9858 x 0.9997 = 0.9855, 
and similarly for males and females. That is, the group-results for " persons" 
require to be multiplied by say 0.986. If, however, only 1.4Â°o be allowed to partially 
(or wholly ?) compensate for a defect due to the wealthier classes possiblj' living â€” as 
has been supposed â€” somewhat longer than the average, then no correction need be 
applied, and the group-result may be regarded as correct. It will, however, be 
decidedly preferable to retain the reduction and consider tho other question inde- 
pendently. 

Five-year groupings would require reduction by factors 0.9967, 0.9954 and 
0.996."5 for" males," " females," and" persons" respectively to reduce to infinitesimal 
groupings. 

We now consider the question of the possible magnitude of a correction for 
variations in the death-rate with wealth. 



96 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Retttrns. 

13. Correction in any age-group for variation of wealth with death-rate in the 
group. â€” If in any age-group it should hapjjen that the death-rates have any aj'ste- 
matic relationship to the wealth of the classes within the group, then the assumption 
that the dying represent the living is not quite correct. This question may be 
presented in several ways. First, let us suppose that the people of any limited age- 
group, divided into claases according to wealth possessed, have characteristic death- 
rates according to class. Then the aggregate of wealth W of the entire group would 
be made up of the wealth W, W", etc., of the classes. And, similarly, the aggregate 
of the wealth (tv) of the dying would be made up of w', w" , %o" ' , etc., the amounts 
accruing by the deaths in the several classes. Then obviously we have : â€” 

(22) TF = Tl" + W" + etc. = R 'lu' + R"w" + etc. = XRw 

where R is the recipi'ocal of the death-rate for the whole, and R', R", etc., are the 
reciprocals of the death-rates of the several classes. Thus it is alao immediately 
evident, on dividing both aides of the preceding equation by Rw, that 

. R' w' R' w 

(23) A= â€¢ \ â€¢ h etc. 

R w R 10 

that is, A is the sum of the 'products of the relative death-rate of the class (aa compared 
with that of the age-group as a whole) into the relative wealth of the class, that is its 
ratio to the wealth of the whole group. 

Or again, writing i?o for XR, we have for Rq, the proper reciprocal to vise as 
multiplier, the weighted mean of the reciprocals of the death-rates, viz. : â€” 

. w' â€ž w" 

(24) Ro = XR = R' . [- R . h etc, 

w w 

This formula indicates that the process is exactly analogous to that of forming 
groups according to age, and it may be also observed that the remarks regarding the 
adoption of a continuous method also apply in their due measure. There would, 
however, not be the same necessity to form small groups, since the distribution of 
death-rate according to wealth will not, at the outside, have wider limits than from 
1 to 2, and, furthermore, is itself very questionable. We may state the whole matter 
in other terms, as follows : â€” 

The assimaption that the persons dying in any age-group represent the living 
may possibly be defective in two particulars, to which reference may now appro- 
priately be made. First, the frequency of death among the section of the community 
with estates sufficiently large to conie under review for probate may perhaps be less 
than the average on account of their better financial ability to secure themselves 
against adverse influence. In some countries this is unquestionably the case, but 
in Australia the favourable climatic conditions would probably minimise such a 
consequence. Unquestionably, no assumption one way or the other can be made 
with safety. Of course, if death is less frequent among the rich, there will be larger 
numbers of rich persons living than is implied by dividing by the average death-rate 
(or multiplying by its reciprocal), and the result foiind without regard thereto, viz., 
{Rw/Hw) will be too small ; i.e., R must be multiplied by a factor somewliat greater 
than unity, 1 + ^> say. tliat is A â€” 1 = !^, if this were the only thing to be taken into 
account : see formula (23). 

On the other hand, those whom death eliminates at any age are evidently 
differentiated vitally from those who remain, and the question arises whether this 
greater vital endowment is characterised on the average by greater endowment of 



The Kate of Devolution. 97 

wealth. If it be go, then it follows that the wealth factor {u â€” w/'Ew) ^shovi\d be 
increased, i.e., it should be multiplied by a quantity somewhat greater than unity, 
1 4-71, say, or if this were the only matter to be taken into account, A â€” 1 = T^. 

Hence the total result must be multiplied by the product of tlieso factors, viz., 
by (1 + i^) (l+7j). In other words, tlie result is perhaps more properly indicated by 
the expression 

w (I + 71) ^ w 

(25) W = R{\ + g -^- '- = (I + I) it" â€” - ,say. 

These two correction-factors are similar in kind, and in fact can hardly be re- 
garded as distinct, forasmuch as the supposition that the living in any age-group may 
be differentiated from the dying in respect of wealth may be regarded as including 
also the differentiation in mortality due to wealth. Both may, therefore, be em- 
braced under one factor, say (1 + ^), where ^ is sensibly equal to ^+ tj (forasmuch 
as ^71 may be considered negligible) ; thus we may assume that A â€” 1 = t,+ y] = ^- 
Unforttuiately no satisfactory data for the determination of these factors exist, 
and at present we can safelj' infer nothing in regard to them, nor even obtain a rough 
idea of the magnitude of their joint effect. 

If we suppose that each age-group is divided into classes corresponding to in- 
dividual wealth, and that the death-rate has been ascertained for each, and suppose 
also that the range of wealth in each class is not very large, any correction of the tj'pe 
of 7) for any class in question will necessarily be negligible, and the correction may 
then be regarded as of the type of t,. Remembering that the s\im of the factors 
w' /w, w" /w, etc., is unity, we may put formula (23) in the following form, viz.: â€” 

w' R' - R u/' R" â€” R 

(26) ^= . + . ~ + etc. 

w R w R 

which shews that the correction depends on the proportion of the wealth contributed 
by each class to the total, and the relative difference of the mortality rates. Since 

R necessarily lies between the least and greatest values of R' R^, some of 

the quantities will be negative and some positive. 



14. Difference of death-rate not determinable from relative number of deaths 

in probate and non-probate classes. â€” We may note lirst of all that tho existing returns 
do not afford the means of deducing the death-rate even of two such (crucial divisions 
as the non-probate and probate classes of the population. For the data are : â€” 
p ; r ; d = d' -\- d" ; these symbols denoting respectively the total population of 
an ago-group, the death-rate, the total death?., those of the non-probate class, and 
of the probate class respectively, the total deaths being equal to those in the two 
classes. Suffixes may be added to denote the successive age-groups. 

If we assume a rate r' corresponding to d', the corresponding population P' is 
determined ; and P" ( ^- P â€” P') gives with d" the death-rate r", while r is obviously 
in no way affected. Or if we assume relations such as r' = ^r, then we have P' = 
d' /^r. Or again, if wo make r" = y*". that is, equal to yrf' / P' = d!' / P" we have 
at orxCe '{d' / d" = P' /P", and we can divide P in this ratio. 

The same can be done, of course, for each age-group. As there is no valid 
reason, however, for assuming the values of ^ or y, we can infer nothing in regard 
to the ili vision of the population into non-]>robato and probate classes.

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



15. Variation of mortality in age-groups according to occupation. â€” ^The attempt 
was made to ascertain whether " occupation," as determined at a Census, would 
throw any light upon the uncertainty arising through possible differences in the rate 
of mortality according to wealth -classes. The resiilt of the analysis is as follows : â€” 

For the Commonwealth of Australia and for the years 1908-1912 the relation 
of death-rate to class of occupation of males, according to age-groups, was found to 
be as indicated in the following table : â€”

The "primary producers" {VI. ), with the lowest death-rate, include persons 
engaged in agriculture, dairying, ijastoral pm-suits, forestrjr, fisheries, water con- 
servation and mining. The "professional" class (I.), also with a relatively low death- 
rate, includes all persons engaged in government, law and its administration, health, 
religion, charity, education, science, and amusement. The " commercial" class 
(III.), also with a death-rate under the average, includes all persons engaged in 
banking, finance, and in the sale and storage of commodities. The class "transport 
and communication" (IV.), which has a death-rate about the average, consists 
maiiily of employees of the railway and postal departments, and all persons engaged 
in the carrying trade, whether by land or water. The "industrial" class (V.), with a 
death-rate distinctly above the average, comprises jjersons engaged in manufacturing 
industries, in the building trade, and in the construction of rail and road ways, 
bridges, and similar things. The "domestic" class (II.), with the highest death-rate 
of all, includes all engaged in the svipply of board and lodging, as well as all engaged 
in other domestic occupations. 

It is evident on consideration that the correlation of wealth and death-rate is 
not on all fours with that of occupational class and death-rate, and, moreover, it is 
also evident, from the arithmetical nature of the case, that the moi'e frequently 
instances of wealth appear among the different occupational classes the mere will 
the relation between wealth and rate of mortality tend to equalise. Thus, for 
group-results of sufficient magnitude, we may sujapose that the marked differences 
of death-rate shewn in the table are, in the correlation of wealth and mortality, 
considerably reduced, and, as a not wholly improbable assumption, may accept for a 
supposititious computation the correlation shewn in the table hereinafter between 
wealth and death-rate.

16. Life Assurance Society's experience of variations in death-rates, according 
to size of policy, etc. â€” The experience of the Au.straliaii Mutual Provident Society 
and of the Scottish Widows' Fund throws some light on the question of the relation 
of wealth and mortality, and has consequently been considered. We remark first 
that the possible variation to be expected in death-rates for any age-group may also 
be roughly gauged by referring to the A.M.P. experience for the period 1849-1903. 
Instead of considering a number of age-groups we may consider the large group for 
the ages 20 to 59 only, and the same age-group for the Commonwealth for males for

This gives us some idea of the range in the rates of mortality. It is not, however, 
in the range in an age-group that we find what is essential. It is the average variation 
with wealth ; some slight indication as to this is to hand in the report on the Mortality 
Experience of the Australian Mutual Provident Society for the 40 years 1849-1888, 
by Mr. Richard Teece (see pp. 42-43).

It will be seen that these results are by no means unequivocally in favour of the 
assumption that (at least as far as the class insuring is concerned, probably the 
thriftier class) mortality-rates are in favour of the wealthier section. 

On page 41 of the same report it is stated that in America "the heavier rate of 
mortality prevails among lives assured for larye sums," though in (ireat Britain and 
Europe the contrarj' is the ca?e. On the experience of the Scottish Widows" Fund, 
1835-1884, G. C. Stenhouse says, that in general " the mortality decreases as the sum 
assured increases.'" 

In Part II. of the same report, pp. 13-14, Mr. Teece suggests "that in the United 
States and these Colonies" (the Australian States) " men with sufTicient means to 
assure for large sums are those who are actively engaged in business, and who are 
annoyed, harassed, and impaired in health by the vicissitudes attendant on business 
pursuits in young covmtries, while the corresponding class in Great Britain is composed 
chiefly of men of leisure .... enabled to lead comparatively tranquil lives .... 
which tends so greatly to prolong life."

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns, 



In the face of the preceding evidence, a priori judgments as to the correlation 
between wealth and mortality must be regarded as of little value, and in any cage it is 
quite certain that the occupational class "primary producers," with the lowest rate 
of luortality, contains an immense majority who are certainly by no means wealthy. 
We have thus shewn not only that we are not entitled to regard the whole occupational 
variation of death-rate as applying to the wealth -variation (since occupations 
characterised by a high rate of mortality are among those which are also characterised 
by considerable wealth), but also that the experience of life insurance in Australia 
lends no real support to the view. 



17. Estimate of possible correction based upon supposititious distributions of 
wealth and mortality. â€” The probate-returns shew that for Victoria in the years 1908- 
1912 the distribution of wealth averaged as follows : â€”

The proportions of the number of estates of various magnitudes to the total 
number coming under review for probate are shewn in column (A) in the table for 
males only. Many estates do not come vmder review at all, on the average about 
5700, if everyone dying is regarded as possessed of some wealth. Hence, since 
ordinary statistics yield the death-rate for the entire age-groujD only, it is necessary 
that these should be entered as persons the wealth of wliose estates, so far as the 
present element of the inquiry goes, is zero. In this way the proportions shewn in 
column marked (B) are obtained. 

We see from this table that the distribution of size of estate follows a curve of 
the hyperbolic type, and from the table of mortality according to occupation that, 
for practically any age-group which seriously affects the result, the relative mortality 
of the different occupations ranges between about 0.6 or 0.7 to about 1.5. Un- 
fortunately, however, there are no available data for correlating the two results, 
and consequently ^ (or A) cannot really be ascertained. It remains, therefore, to 
formulate some plausible supposition, and to ascertain what the value of this cor- 
recting factor would be if such supposition were really applicable. This will give at 
least a very rough indication of the extent of the nncertainty in any deduced result 
which neglects' the correction. 

Although, as pointed out, no definite correlation between occvipation and wealth 
has been ascertained, we shall nevertheless assume for our purpose that a somewhat 
analogous range of variation of death-rate applies to differences of wealth possessed ; 
the assum])tion being arbitrarily based on the general but very uncertain ground 



The Rate of Devolution. 



lOl 



that financial resources can command a degree of comfort and attention that conduce 
to longevity. The difference between moderate and considerable wealth, if it really 
be in favoiir of the latter, can however be only very slight. Thus, with gome ex- 
ceedingly slight degree of plausibility, it may be supposed that the persons of zero 
wealth have the highest mortality -rate (or lowest factor R), and those of the greatest 
wealth the lowest mortality-rate (or highest factor R). 

It should be noted that the ratio {R' â€” R)/R is independent of the absolute 
value of the death-rate, and the ratio w' /w is similarly independent of the absolute 
amount of the wealth of each class within a group ; further, the relative numbers in 
each class are necessary only to ensure that the weighted mean of the death-rate 
gives the general death-rate. Hence, we may regard the above table as a possible 
representation of the existing facts, even if not a probable one. 

Having regard to every aspect of the matter, it is likely that the variation of 
death-rate with wealth, if it exist at all, does not pass through a wider range than say 
1 to 1 J or 1.064 to 0.798. Thus, taking into account the relative numbers in each 
class, the relative reciprocals of the death-rates may be (arbitrarily) assumed to be 
those shewn in the following table, line i. being taken from the preceding table : â€”

* The difference of iii. from unity only has been used. 

The values in to]) line may thus be taken as those of tv'/w, and the difference 
between the values in lino iii. and unity as the values of (R'â€”R)/R, etc. Thus 
the value of this factor, viz.. A â€” 1 or ^, is the algebraic sum of the products of Ime 
i., tlio top line, by these differences. This gives the result ^ = + 0.2308, a pro- 
portion which, of course, is serious. It is evident from the table that the result 
depends almost wholly on the difference from the mean of the death-rate of persons 
|)03Sossing the large estates ; since neglecting all whose estates are imder â‚¬3000 
the result would have been ^ = + 0.1885. It is thus quite clear that the doath-rate 
of tliose who are the main contributors to the probate wealth -returns profoimdly 
influence the results, and here it may be observed that the death-rate of so 
restricted a class must vary greatly from year to year; indeed, a determination for 
a period of anything less than 10 years is probably of small value. In any case it is 
to be observed that it is unsafe in the light of the available evidence to assume the 
death-rate of the wealthy in any age-group differs systematically from the death- 
rate of the entire group. It must be based upon statistical evidence before it can 
be admitted. 



18. Consequence of assuming that life assurance rates should be adopted. â€” 
It has been suggested by Mr. A. M. Laughton, Government Statistician of Victoria. 
" that the mortality-rates amongst property owners will correspond with the rates 
relating to assured lives as given in the published experience of the Australian 



102 



Tdtj ESMJjiATION OF WEALTH FROM PrOBATE RETURNS. 



Mutual Provident Society" (Victorian Year Book, 1912-13, pp. 270-271). Regarding 
this it may be said that the experience of a large assurance company necessarily 
includes a very large body of recently selected lives, and although the A.M.P. 
experience, which haa been used, dates back to 1849, tlie number of policies issued 
in the earlier years of the Companj'^'a history was go small, compared with the number 
issued in more recent years, that the experience may properly be regarded as one in 
which medical selection had plaj^ed a very prominent part. The effect produced by 
thia cause is that a rate of mortality shewn is much lighter than that experienced by a 
similar body of lives not subject to medical selection, and consequently for the 
purpose in view the A.M.P. rate must be considered as being probablj' unduly favour- 
able, and as giving too high a inviltiplier. 

It is, moreover, for reasons already pointed out, by no means certain or even 
probable that the possession of wealth and acceptance as a satisfactory life by an 
insurance office are coincident facts, or that the " healthy-life" experience of an 
insurance office is to be considei'ed as applicable only to the wealthy. The signifi- 
cance of the A.M.P. mortality rates for healthy and loaded lives appears in the follow- 
ing table of the reciprocals of those rates (or rather the vahies of q^) which will be 
sufficiently near for the purpose. These are, of covirse (approximately) the factors 
to be employed. They are given for the ages 25, 35 ... . 95, viz., the central 
ages of the more important groups (see A.M.P. Report on Mortality Ex]3erience, 
1849-1903).

The column, " relative weight," shews the inean for the years 1908-1912 of the 
net wealth contributed by the successive probate groups, and is probably sufficiently 
accurate for the period 1901-10. We indicate the difference according to the 
general values in the two last columns. These results are as hereunder : â€” 

Taking the reciprocals of the average death-rates for the period 1901-1910 as a 
basis, the results would be : â€” 

A.M.P. Mortality of healthy males (1849-1903) would give the 

1901-1910 result multiplied by 1.2481 

A.M.P. Mortality of healthy and loaded malea (1849-1903) would 

give the 1901-1910 result multiphed by 1.1576 

Actual Mortality AustraUa, 1881-1890, would give the 1901-1910 

result multiplied by . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.7885 



The Rate of Devolution. 103 

Taking the reciprocals of the average death-rates for 1881-1890, the reaulta 
would be : â€” 

A.M.P. Mortality of healthy males (1849-1903) would give the 

1881-1890 result multiplied by 1.5828 

A.M.P. Mortality of healthy and loaded males (1849-1903) would 

give the 1881-1890 result multiplied by . . . . . . . . 1.4681 

Actual Mortality Australia, 1901-1910 1.2682 

In view of the fact that the value of 1 + ^ was found to be about 1.1490, on 
the suppositions made, and that the resrdt based on the 1901-1910 mortality, compared 
with the A.M.P. experience of (1849-1903) for " healthy and loaded male lives," 
gives 1.1576, it might perhaps be assumed that a correction-factor of 1.15 is probably 
justifiable. This, however,. I do not believe to be the case. It would be so only if 
the assumption referred to had any validity. After a wide review of the question, and 
in the light of all the available evidence, it seems that in Australia at any rate, there 
is grave reason to doubt the existence of a definite correlation of wealth and longevity, 
and, if so, the supposition by means of which ^ was estimated above has no validity. 
It is certainly not based upon evidence, and rests merely ujaon a more or less plausible 
assumption, against which, as has been shewn, there is at least some evidence. 

We now indicate the numerical consequences of a difference in the mortality 
rates of classifications according to wealth within the same age-group 



1 9. Consequence of death-rate being less among the wealthy. â€” Suppose that the 
population at any age is divided into two classes differing in wealth, and that the 
wealthy experience a lower rate of mortality than the less wealthy. This will have 
the effect of altering the distribution with the lapse of time (when the transfer of 
the survivore of any age-group to a group of greater age is considered). It will 
follow as a consequence that the aggregate of the wealthier classes will tend to 
relatively increase with age as compared with the aggregate of the less wealthy 
class, other things being equal. Other consequences will also follow, which we shall 
now proceed to consider. We shall assume that : â€” 

(i.) The average unit of wealth is w' for the poorer sub-group ; and 
"â€¢' (1 -| Â«') for the richer sub-group ; 

(ii.) That this imit does not increase with time, or if it does increase, that it 
increases with time alwaj'S by the same ratio whether the amount be 
large or small ; 

(iii.) That the death-rate for the poorer sub-group is r, and for the richer 
[r â€” h), where h is a positive quantity. 

The following propositions follow as a necessary consequence of these three assump- 
tions : â€” 

(n) Since by hypothesis the numbers of the poorer sub-group are decreasing 
more rapidly than those of the richer sub-gi'oup, the ratio of the numbers 
dying with large estates (or paying probate) to the number dying with 
sniall oatatos (or who do not jjay probate) should tend to be an increasing 
ratio. 

(/>) Since by liypothesis the individual wealth of the persons remaining alive 
is unaltered, and, owing to the greater death-rate of the poorer sub- 
group there are relatively fewer in that group, the average for the 
combined sub-groups must tend to increase with age. 



104 



The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



(c) Since by hjiDothesis the individual wealth is the same, and death has more 
rapidly decreased the poorer sub-group than it has the richer sub-group, 
the ratio of the aggregate possession of the latter to the former will be 
an increasing ratio. 

These results are perhaps seen more clearly when set out formally (algebraically). 
In the table herevinder m denotes the numbers in tho poorer sub-group, and n those 
in the richer, the death-rates being respectively r and {râ€”h). After a \init of time 
the groups are reduced by death to m (1 â€” r) and n [1 â€” (r -h)] respectively, and the 
aggregate of wealth will be as shewn in the table hereunder, provided we suppose 
that the tvealth does not pass by death to persojis in the same age-rjroaps. The i^rocesses 
by means of which the various quantities are obtained are obvious.

The above, however, represents only the effect on the living. We can establish 
the caae for the dying in a similar way. 

Let the persons in the two classes, each individual possessing respectively iv' 
and w' (1 + u'), be again to and n ; and the respective death-rates initially r^ and r^. 
Then the average wealth, when a unit of time has elapsed, will be : â€”

If, then, we suppose that r, and r^ change with time in the same ratio, say become

and if, as we previously supposed, r^ be less than r,, tho fraction (1 â€” 'â€¢,) / (1 â€” r.) will 
be less than unity, thus the ivealth-average will become greater. 

It is important to observe that the expressions (27) and (28) cannot be used with 
any great assurance to deduce values of r, and r^, because they represent, after all, 
very small changes. We shall illustrate this point by considering a numerical 
instance. 



The Rate of Devolution. 105 

The death-rate for the age-group 60 to 70 for "persons" is abovit 0.034. Suppose 
then that we aasvune r^ is about .04, and /â€¢, about .02, and that the ratio of w to n ia 
as 3 to 2 (whicii is about the proportion of the non-probate class to the probate class). 
Then in tliese two last expressions we should have : â€” 

/ 2 X 0.02 u \ 

w' 1 + = w' (1 + 0.25 u') 

V 3 X 0.04 -f 2 X 0.02/ 

2 X .02 u \ 

1+ -â€” = ?^â€¢' (I + 0.253886 m'). 

S.^t:!!' 0.04 + 2x .02 / 
O.ftS 

It will be seen that the influence is extremely small ^ for even so great a difference 
of t\ and i\ as is iinplied in the ratio 2 to 1. It is moreover evident that so small a 
quantity could be easily' mt'sUod by other elements affecting the results, viz., changes 
in the rate of acciunulation of wealth, irregularities in the deaths, in the sizes of 
estates coming under review, and so on; in fact, it goes far to shew that no analysis 
of the respective nximbers or of the respective amounts appearing in age-groups is 
likely to lead to anything definite, either as to relative mortality among the non- 
probate and probate classes, or as to the possible rate at which the wealth of either 
actually grows. 

In the jareceding table shewing symbolically the averages for the living at the 
commencement and end of a period, the results, on the basis supposed, would be 
respectively (1-f 0.40 Â«') and (1 + 0.041517 u'), so that the difference between the 
beginning and end of a period will be relatively very small, and the conclusion drawn 
equally applies, for although u' may be large the relative changes therein will be small. 



20. Existing statistical data point to the conclusion that the devolution-rate 
method must be applied to each sex separately. â€” The retmns of Victoria for 1908-1912, 
given in tho table hereunder, shew that there is a remarkable constancy in the ratio 
of the number of the non-probate to tho probate class, from 40 to 90 years of age for 
both males and females, and certainly to somewhat regular changes in the average 
wealth in each age-group, but, as already pointed out, nothing can be deduced from this 
table in regard to the relative death-rates of the probate and non-probate classes. 
Column (7), shewing the wealth per head of the dying, reveals a marked increase with 
age, the maximum being, for males, inthe group 80-89, nnd the niaxiimun for females 
in the group 70-79. This difforence shews, of course, tliat the factors a and A-will differ 
for the sexes. Other striking features of difference are that the wealth per head ia 
roughly between three and four times as great for the males as for the females, and 
that the ratio of the non-probate to the probate class differs materially. The con- 
clusion is that separate returns should be made out for males and females, and, in com- 
putations of total wealth, that formulae (3) to (12), and (19) to (28) cannot be applied 
to the sexes taken together on the assumption that they may be considered as forming 
a homogenef>us population. The same observation is accentuated by the character- 



1. If W = 0, the ratio of the lower <|iiaiitity to the upikt is I.O; if it' ^ 1.00, tlie ratio beconies

iatic difference in the death-rates. From this it follows that, in order to deduce 
accurate results, we must, in the application of the devolution-rate method, treat the sexes 
separately, and not attempt to combine them so as to calculate results for "persons" 
merely. This dictum will be confirmed by a study of the table herevmder : â€”

The Rate of Devolution. 



107 



We proceed now to consider the question of the influence of variations in the 
distribution of wealth according to age, and in mortality according to age, upon the 
devolution-rate factors a and k. 



21. Variation in the relative amounts contributed in each age-group and its 

consequence. â€” It is now evident how jn'ofoundlj- the "distribution of wealth accord- 
ing to age" affects the results. This distribution, viz., the system of ratios for each 
age-group of w/llw, {ti in the tables for Victoria, 1908-1912) is very variable from year 
to year, but in general shews no sign of definite progression. The uncertainty of 
individual results has already been estimated, and is seen in the table hereunder of 
values of a' and k' for Victoria, shewing how variable these factors are, notwith- 
standing that in the former the effect of the particular death-rate for the year, aa 
well as total wealth disclosed in probate, has been eliminated, and in the latter the 
effect of the total wealth onlv. 



Attention has akeady been dra.wn to the differences in the values of u and oi pu 
for Victoria in successive years. The distribution-effect is seen also in the difference 
of the results for New South Wales and those for Victoria. The values for a and k, 
corrected so as to give the results for infinitesimally small groups, are : â€”

The extent of the agreement between English and Australian results may be seen 
by calculating the relative amount contributed by each age-group after redistri- 
buting* the grouping of Victoria for 1908-1912, and Now South Wales for 1911, so

* Numbers living to one dying. 

The results shew most distinctly a general agreement, though not a very close 
one. The effect of the variation can be readily computed by assuming the recip- 
rocals of the death-rates for the group somewhat in accordance with experience. 
On adopting the multipliers shewn in the final column, which are approximately 
those of Mr. Mallet's report {op. cit., p. 73), we obtain the results in the table above. 
These shew a range of â€” 5.3 per cent, to +8.0 per cent., about the mean of the four 
results, the individual figures based on this mean being given in the bottom line of tlie 
table ; or if the English results for 1906 were taken as a basis, the results for New 
South Wales for 1911 would be 15.3 per cent, greater. Hence, this is the order of 
loncertainty, even when the death rates are identical in the respective countries. In 
view of the general agreement between the successive age-groups, this is not a little 
remarkable, and it goes to confirm the view already expressed that results obtained 
from returns of a single year are liable to a large measure of uncertainty, and indeed 
that in order to obtain anything like reliable figures we should use at least five years, 
and preferably ten. Referring to the English results, it will be seen that there are 
appreciable changes in the values in Columns A and B for the different age-groups. 

Before dismissing this part of the subject, it may be noted that it is probable 
the distribution of wealth according to age varies considerably with fluctuations 
that occur in the general economic condition of any community, and exist even in 



1. Journal Roy. Stat. Soc, Ixxvi., 1908, p. 74. 



The Rate of Devolution. 



109 



commmiities so near akin economically and socially as those of the States of New 
South Wales and Victoria. For the limited periods of time for which the necessary 
data are available identity of distribution is by no means characteristic. This is 
shewn by the table hereunder, in which are given the results for Victoria for 
1908-15 (see Fig. 4, page 132), and those for New South Wales for 1911-13 and 
1911-15, for comparison one with another. 

The distributions are sensibly different for males and females, and are by no 
means identical for States â€” apparently similarly circumstanced â€” even when the 
means of a series of years are taken. It may be noted that, taking no account of 
absentees, the average wealth per estate, etc., for the periods indicated is : â€”

The Ratk of Devolution. 



Ill 



We shall now consider the causes of the irregularities referred to and the mode of 
eliminating their prejudicial effect. 

22. Necessity for a correction for infrequent appearance of large estates. â€” Very 
large estates appear but infrequently in probate returns, the infrequency increaeing 
with the size of the estate and diminishing with the size of the population. Let ua 
consider any table shewing the number of estates of different magnitvide in any 
territory {e.g., the table from the Prussian Returns). It is manifest that if we take 
the devolution-period to be 22.2 years (which perhaps, however, is somewhat below 
the correct amount), the average frequency in Prussia of the appearance of estates of 
these sizes, in a probate aggregate for all age-groups, will be the number existing 
divided into the devolution-period. Thus, if we call this period K, and the niunber 
N, the frequency, F, is N/K, or the average interval of appearance K/ N. It is 
obvious from this that the average frequency of appearance in a particular age-group 
will be considerably less. If we assume that it is equally likely to appear in the 
probate-class in any age-group, then the relative freqviency in that age-group to the 
frequency of apjjearing in the aggregate of the age-groups is measured by the number 
of probates in the former to the number for the latter (the aggregate number). 

Let the nimiber of probate estates in any age-group be denoted by J5',with a 
suffix to define the particular group, and the number for all groups by E = S-B' : 
then this relative frequency is only the ( E' / E)th part of what we found before, since 
the average frequency for the age-group is : â€” 



(29). 



F' = F . E'/E. 



Thus, if we take the nmnber k, the multiplying factor deduced for Victoria for 
the period 1908-1912, multiplied by the ratio of the Prussian death-rate to the Vic- 
torian death-rate, we obtain 22.2, which may be regarded as holding approximately 
for Prussia. Accepting this, we should get the following results : â€”

Owing to the large rate of infantile mortality for Prussia, this figure 22.2 is 
perhaps rather too small ; but even so, it will not touch the argument, and the 
frequency shewn will be affected only by the ratio of 22.2 to the true value. 

Detailed probate statistics for as long a period as five years are at present avail- 
able in Australia for two States only, viz., Victoria and New South Wales. In the 
Victorian retiu-ns for 1908-12, for estates of males of over Â£50,000 thei'e is only an 
average of 11.8 jaer axmum, and over Â£100,000 only 3.2 per annum, corresponding to 
an aggregate nvmibor of 8488 deaths. It is evident from this that tlie appearance 
of the larger estates will be relatively rare, and since tliej' may occur at any age, 
tho values of pu â€” see formula (11) â€” are subject to large variations, and con- 
sequently the values of a and of k. It is only by studying the experience of each 
age-group and the fluctuation in the values oi pu that we can hope to ascertain what 
the general trend with time is, and whether tho results of a particular year for 
each age-group differ from the average. Wheii for a sufficient number of years 
such details are to hand, the average trend can be ascertained, and appropriate cor- 
rections can be made.

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



Suppose, for example, a very large estate comes under review in probate returns, 
say once in 7 years (on the average). Then for the (average) six years in which such 
an estate has not appeared the computed results will be in defect, because the estate is in 
existence, though the evidence of that existence and the measure of its magnitude 
are not to hand. On the other hand, suppose it is included in an annual, or even in a 
quinquennial mean. The result will be greatly in excess of the true annual result, 
and sensibly in excess of the true quinquennial result. 

A more or leas definite appreciation of this consideration has, without doubt, 
led statisticians to regard with favour a multiplier which does not oscillate rapidly 
like that derived from the results of a single year. Bvit it has ordinarily been for- 
gotten that even when such a multiplier is used, a single year's results are of very 
limited value. The conclusion is that in order to improve the technique a study 
must be made when sufficient returns are to hand of the frequency of estates of different 
sizes. For this reason it is important that tabulations should be made of sizes of 
estates in different age-groups. From the table of values of pu â€” see formula (11) â€” 
the important groups are : â€” less than 30 ; 30 to 49 ; 50 to 69 ; 70 and over; the 
extra work, however, involved in tabulating in smaller groups would not be con- 
siderable, and it would be a great advantage in studying the characteristic of wealth 
frequency and its variation with age. As already pointed out, there is an average 
annual progression in the value of p of a sensible amoimt. In the following tables the 
frequency for estates of various magnitudes are given, but not the distribvition of 
this frequency according to age. 

In general, however, not only are the data insufficiently comjolete, but also it is 
impracticable to apjDly corrections for the appearance or non-appearance of large 
estates ; it is preferable, therefore, to take the mean of a sufficient range of years 
to be able to accept the result as substantially accurate. 



23. Example oÂ£ variations in the factor k and their consequences. â€” The 

impossibility of regardmg the results deduced from any one year as at all satisfactory 
owing to the infrequent appearance of large estates and other irregularities in the 
data, is well illustrated by taking the Victorian yearly data for the years 1908 to 1915.

The Rate of Devolution. 113 

It may be noted also that these averages would correspond to the date 1912.0, 
and indicate that the uncorrected estimate for the wealth of Victoria (including the 
absentees) was then Â£254,021,000, of which 72.9613 per cent, belonged to males, and 
27.0387 per cent, belonged to females. 

These results for Victoria may be compared with those of New South Wales in 
section 21 herein. The mean of the tliree results are k = 27.75 and 39.37 for males 
and females respectively; but the three years 1911-13 taken together give 29.95 
and 37.81 for the factors k, corrected for a continuous wealth cm-ve. We thus have 
the following results, viz. : â€” 

Victoria. 1908-191.5 k = for males 29.52; for females, 41.64 
X.S.W., 1911-1913 â€ž â€ž 29.95 â€ž â€ž 37.81 

X.S.W., 1911-1915 â€ž â€ž 32.26* â€ž â€ž 44.30* 

* Deduced frcnu later flgiires for Xew South Wales for 1911 to 1915 inclusive. 

the result being thus in very close agreement for males, and in fair agreement for 
females. If one constant is to be used for males and females combined, these must 
be weighted according to the aggregates of wealth. This gives (for the same periods): 
Victoria (loersons), k = 32.01; X.S.W. (persons), k = 31.43; or N.S.W. frojpa 
1911 to 1915 (persons), k = 34.42 ; or if we combine the results for Victoria 1908-15 
with those of N.S.W. 1911-1915, weighted according to the totals of the probates 
(inckiding absentees), viz., for the former 64.66 millions sterling, for the latter 50.41 
millions, we get for " persons" 33.07 for the two States combined, which would 
correspond with the epoch year 1912.7 about, and might be accepted as a value for 
the Commonwealth. 

24. Variation of the factor k with variation of the death-rate. â€” ^^> have seen 
that the factor k varies witli changes in the distribution of wealth according to age, 
and also with relative variations of mortality according to age (i< and d). The latter 
must, of course, be (imperfectly) reflected in the general death-rates. This will now 
be considered. For the Commonwealth and Queensland with a distribvition of 
wealth according to age at least approximately correct, we found values, see Â§ 11, 
which gave the following values for k, when corrected from 5-year groups so as to 
give a continuous distribution instead of grotips. viz., the numbeis in the first two 
lines below ; these take tlie place of those on p 94.

If those values of k are multiplied by the corresponduig dcciMinial death-rates

The results, which, as stated, apply to the years in question only (not to the 
decennium as a whole), shew that while the range of uncertainty due to variation of 
death-rates is probablj' not very great, it is not negligibly small. 

In order to deal with the probate results as a totality (i.e., for persons), we may 
suppose that the ratio of wealth appearing through deaths of females bears a constant 
ratio to that appearing through the deaths of males. This, for the years 1908-1915 
m Victoria, and 1911-1913 for New South Wales combined, gives the ratio 0.24880 to 
1,* the totals being for males Â£76,578,929, and females Â£19,053,467. These ratios 
applied as weights to the factors k for males and females, give the following Com- 
monwealth results for persons, viz. : â€” 

1886, k = 25.76 ; 1896, k = 28.82 ; 1906, k = 33.21 
Ratios 1.000 1.119 1.289 

It would seem also that we might weight the death-rates of males and females pro- 
portionally to the total wealth, to ascertain the change of the factor k. Using the 
mean of the rates of the group of years in the successive decennia, we obtain the 
following weighted death-rates, viz. :â€” 

Instant .. .. 1886,0 1896.0 1906.0 

Weighted, combined 
death-rate irreciprocal .016035 =1/61.162 :013786 =1/73.527 :011966= 1/83.570 

The ratio of the first reciprocal 0.061162 to the others is 1.2022 and 1.3664. 
If the vakies of k for " persons" be computed from those given for males and females 
in the table in Â§ 11, we get, for the same years, viz., 1886.0, 1896.0 and 1906.0, the 
values 25.99, 28.60, 32.38 respectively, the ratios of the second and third to the first 
being 1.1000 and 1.2459. The two are only in fair agreement. The weightmg of the 
death-rates is probably not the best course to follow. 



25. Estimate of secular variation of k for Australia. â€” The reduction of the 
death-rate tends â€” other things being equal â€” to ensure an increase m the factor k, 
and as that reduction has been fairly regular, it is possible to adopt a regvilarly pro- 
gressive value of this factor without material error. Of course, the general death- 
rate is largely affected by the infantile and early death-rates, which have no effect 
on the probates, and is therefore not quite satisfactory. Bvit if we take the re- 
ciprocals of the death-rates from the age 20 to the end of life, and deduce the weighted 
results for " persons," the ratios of the second and third to the earliest result are 
1.0909 and 1.1493. The growth for 10 and 20 years of the coefficient k might be 
regarded, therefore, as very approximately given by the following ratios, viz. : â€” 



* When later the 1911-15 results for New Soutli Wales wvre substituted for those of 1911-13, thia 
ratio became 0.24111 to 1.

whole. * The following values are thus indicated for the Commonwealth for the

It is not to be understood that the precision is certainly as indicated by the 
figures as given ; these factors may possibly be in error even in the units place ; 
they are found by making m = 1.01, and k for 1913, 33.403. 



26. Correction for wealth of absentees. â€” The New Soutli Wales and also the 
Victorian retiu-ns shew that an appreciable amount of wealth belongs to " absentees," 
viz., to persons whose estates, and generally whose domicile, are in New South Wales 
or Victoria, but who die outside the State. The State records do not furnish their 
age at death, consequently all that is known is their numbers and the \-alues of their 
estates. The following table shews the results for the years 1908-15 inclusive, and 
are divided according to sex and into two four -year groups. A small niunber of 
" unsjiecified" cases are also included, i.e., cases for which the ages are not given : â€” 



1. The actual results were :â€” Males. 0.01693. 0.01.'').')3: 0.01-J68 : Females, 0.01316. 0.01202,

0.01480, and 0.014IK! : the reciprocals are 61.96, 67.57, and 71.28. the ratios of the second and third 
to the lirst heing l.dlHIJand 1.1504. 

2. This would give 33.734 as the average for the year 1914. 15y taking the aggregate of all tlie 
probates of Victoria for 1908-191.'>, of New South Wales for 1911-1915. of Queensland for 1916, we 
obtain the following distribution for the several age-groups as liefore : â€” 

Males .00012 .00059 .00804 .02429 .06950 .13863 .20752 .32274 .21420 .01431 Total 1.00000.

This gives with the mean of the ratios of the living to the dying for Victoria an<l New South Wales for 
1913-1915 the result kâ€ž= 30.945 ; k/ 43.848 ; A> == 33.416, which would coincide with the epoch 
1914.0 for 1914.5, this is ab(mt 33.583, whidi may 'Â« compared with 33.734 above. Having regard 
to all the facts the latter is believed to be the more accurate value.

* In these results the inispecifled cases as to age are not included : they have been distributed 
(proportionally) among the age-groups. 

The results for New South Wales differ sensibly from those of Victoria as regards 
" amounts," though not as regards " numbers " ; while those of Queensland differ 
in both respects. The latter, however, cannot be regarded as normal in view of the 
probable influence of the war on the results, and consequently no appreciable error 
will probably arise if they are simply proportionally distributed among the age- 
groups. Having regard to the inherent limitations of ascertaining the rate of 
devolution, the imprecision of the distribution suggested will be relatively negligible. 

If a ^ factor be used, the simplest method will be to merely add the absentee 
cases to the aggregate of the fully specified and vxnspecified cases before multiplying 
by the factor. If, however, the aggregate of wealth is deduced from the fully 
specified cases only, the total of which is B, and the totals for the absentees and 
unspecified be A and U respectively, then the correction factor c, to be multiplied 
into the result, will be : â€” 

(31) c = (-B -f U + A) / B 

or, if the unspecified cases have been distributed, and i?' = S + C/, we have 

(31a) c = {B' + A) / B' 

as the correcting factor. This is probably of the order of 1.07 or 1.08 for the entire 
Commonwealth. 



27. Effect of insurance policies in probate returns. â€” In a country like Australia, 
where life assurance is relatively widespread, the inclusion of the amounts of insur- 
ance paid in probate returns has the effect of making them appear too favourable in 
respect of accurately representing the wealth of the balance of the population, inas- 
much as the executors of deceased persons have received the full value of the policies 
with all bonuses, etc., while the value which can be regarded as (potentially) possessed 
by the balance of the population is, of course, only the fvill " surrender -value. "^ 



1. This has been pointed out by Mr. A. M. Laughton, F.I.A., F.r.A., etc., and see Victorian 
Year Boolv, 1913-14, pp. 589-592. 



The Rate of Devolution. 117 

The opposite is the case with regard to annuities, pensions, superannuation allow- 
ances, etc., which tend in the direction of causing an under-estimate of the amount of 
wealth possessed by the living. We proceed to form a quantitative estimate of these 
influences on the results. 

From recent returns it appears that of the total claims under assurance policies 
paid by life assurance companies in Australia, about four -sevenths of the total is 
payable in respect of the death of the policyholder, and about three -sevenths in respect 
of the maturity of policies. For the five years 1908 to 1912, the total amount of the 
claims made in Australia \inder life assiu-ance policies was Â£11,884,748, which, on 
the basis quoted above, would represent a payment of abovit Â£6,790,000 in respect 
of death benefits. For the five years under consideration, the amount of the assurance 
policies in force in Victoria represented about 32 per cent, of the total for Australia, 
and consequently the paj-ment for death benefits in Victoria in respect of life 
assurance policies was approximately 0.32 X Â£6,790,000, or about Â£2,170,000 in the 
aggregate for the five years 1908 to 1912, or say, on the average Â£434,000, in a year. 

Similarly, for the same period, the amount paid as annuities by life assurance 
companies in Victoria was approximately Â£25,000 per anninn. 

From the returns of one of the largest of the Australian companies, it appears 
that, as at 31st December, 1913, the appropriate reserve value of svmis assured and 
bonuses aggregating to Â£96,750,000 was Â£29,300,000, or about 30% of the face value 
of the policies, while, in the case of life annuities of Â£79,000 per annum, the capitalised 
value was Â£665,000, or on the average about 8.4 years' pvu-chase. It would thus 
appear that for the 5 years 1908 to 1912, the exclusion in the case of Victoria of con- 
sideration of the special features of life assurance and annuity policies w'ould have the 
effect of overstating the wealth of that State by k times 70 per cent. - of Â£434.000, 
or about Â£300,000 X h, in respect of assiu-ance, and of imderstating it by the absolute 
amount of Â£25,000 multiplied by 8.4, viz., Â£210,000 in respect of amiuities. The 
quantity k denotes the appropriate multiplier iised for converting amount subject to 
probate into total wealth. \^'ith a multiplier of say 32,^ the net result would be 
an overstatement of about Â£9,400,000 in the estimate of the total wealth of Victoria. 
A correction for this would reduce the estimate to about 96 per cent, of the imcor- 
rected total wealth.* Consequently, in order to allow for the overestimate due to 
the falling-in of life policies at death, the results for the Australian States should be 
multiplied by about 0.96. 

28. Ratio of net to gross values of estates in probate returns. â€” In certain cases 
the only available data are the gross values of the estates appearing in probate 
returns. Where this is the case, it is clearly necessary to deduce the latter from the 
former in order to ascertain the total private wealth. Unfortimately, however, 
complete information does not exist as to the relation between the two values, 
inasmuch as available information connecting these extends back only a few years. 
The circumstances are different in each State : each will therefore be referred to in 
turn. 

Victoria. â€” The retiuris for 1908-15 give the ratios in tlie table hereinider, in 
which the available results for New South Wales, South and ^\'estern Australia, and 
Qiieensland are also given for comparison. 



2. That is 100% â€” 30Â°o, vide supra. 3. The result for 190S-12 for Victoria is about 32.64. 

4. If we take Â£233,000,000 as the average tot-al wealth for the period considered, the result is 0.9596.

This ratio or factor of reduction is, however, not uniformly distributed in regard 
to age, as one might naturally expect, and differs for males and females. It has 
consequently been taken out in sex and age-groups, the results being as follows : â€”

Females, Victoria, 1908-12.

Persons .9823 .8802 .8071 .7268 .7700 .8245 .8290 .8781 .9249 

The ratio of the net to gross values appears for every age to be characteristically 
different for males and females. A curve drawn through the group-values for each 
sex indicates that the encumbrance on estates increases in each to the age of about 
35 or 36, and then diminishes, the ratio of net to gross values being about 0.67 in 
the case of males, and about 0.815 in the case of females. This dissimilarity is 
confirmed when the results are taken out for all ages in one group, the result for 
Victoria for the period 1908-1912 being as follows : â€” 

Including absentees Males .85176 Females .90139 Persons .86167 

Excluding â€ž â€ž .84658 â€ž .89715 â€ž .85673 

Except that there is less encmnbrance on the estates of females, the two con- 
tinuous curves, which are indicated by the group-values in the preceding table, are 
very similar. (See Fig. 7, page 133.) 

The facts shew that males and females cannot be regarded as a homogeneous 
oTOup, and consequently probate results should not be grouped together for " per- 
sons," but kept separately for males and females ; the grouping of them together 
tends to increase the measure of uncertainty when deductions are made of the total 
private wealth either from net or from gross value. 

Neiv South Wales. â€” ^The relation of gross and net values for New South Wales 
depends upon retiu-ns for the decade 1902-1911. Mr. J. B. Trivett, Statistician 
of that State, gives the results, shewn later, from Probate Court and Stamp Duty 
returns ; see Official Year Book, New South Wales, 1912, p. 257. The gross value 
irrespective of encumbrances, was shewn in his report, also the net value of the 
estates, since it is upon these that the duty is paid. The two retiu-ns liave not been 
co-ordinated year by year, however, and the nmnbers are not in exact agreement, 
inasmuch as Probate Coiu-t returns refer to the year ending 31st December, and the 
Stamp Duty returns to the year ending 30th June. 

This involves some difficulty in ensuring a satisfactory determination of the 
ratio in question. However, the average ratios for the periods 1902-5, 1906-8, 
1909-11^, are 0.8322,0.8669, and 0.9526 respectively, while the ratio for the whole 
period 1902-11 is 0.8907, though the mean of the tliree ratios is only 0.8839. The 
results indicate that for New South Wales there is probabi}^ an iixcrease of about 
0.018 per annum on a mean of about 0.884, and for Victoria about 0.017 on about 



1. Obtained by dividing tlie total values, gross or net, by the number of estates, and ascertaining 
the ratio of the quotients. 



The Rate of Devolution, 119^ 

0.840 ; in other words, the rate of the improvement for Victoria is about 60% of 
that of New South Wales. Such results cannot, of course, be extrapolated in order 
to discover the relationship between net and gross values for earlier jDeriods. 

South AiiMralia and Western Australia. â€” The only resiilts available for the 
States of South and Western Australia are those for 1912, the results bemg : â€” for the 
former, 1391 estates, the gross and net values of which were respectively Â£2,408,732 
and Â£2,011,589 ; for the latter, 864 estates, the gross and net values being Â£841,800 
and Â£605,622. These give the ratios 0.83528 and 0.72575. 

For the State of Queensland there are no available data shewing the relationship 
of gross and net values before 1916. For that year the data give the result shewn in 
the preceding table (earlier part of this section). 

For the State of Tasmania there are no available data. 

The Commonwealth.- â€” By weighting the preceduig results we obtain a factor for 
the Commonwealth, viz., 0.8620, which may be applied throughout if we assume 
that this relation is constant. Such assumiDtion is, of course, a precarious one, for 
it is quite possible that the indication of the results for New South Wales for the past 
ten years and those for Victoria applj' generally. 

29. Effect of re-grants and re-seals. â€” In estimating wealth from probates, it 
is necessary to take account â€” inter alia â€” of the amounts appearing in what are 
known as re-grants and re-seals. The former denote second probates granted, for 
example, where the values of the estate are found to be quite different from what 
initially appeared to be the case : the latter denote actions taken by the probate 
authorities of a State (other than that in which the possessor of the wealth was 
domiciled) for the portion of the estate within the territory over which they have 
jurisdiction. 

The aggregates of the numbers for a combination of States are obviously in excess 
of the number dying; the aggregates of the wealth, however, contain no such duplica- 
tion, but the k factor to be applied would probably be that of the State in which they 
initially arise, not the State to which they are referred. In view of the great measure 
of vmcertainty in the " multiplier," however, it will suffice to add their values to 
the probate-totals. 

30. Corrections for wealth passing by settlements. â€” In Chap. I., Â§ 1, of this part, 
p. 68, it is mentioned that de Foville has shewn that accoimt must be taken of 
settlements, which are virtually anticipations of inheritance, and also that Gini has 
established that, in Italy, the interval between successive settlements was sensibly 
equal to the interval between successions. 

It is obvious that when wealth is conveyed by gift diu'ing a lifetime, the a<?t of 
conveyance operates to reduce the amount which otherwise would have appeared 
later in the probate returns of the donors, and it increases the wealth of the donees, 
who in general are of a yoiuiger age. It thus unduly diminishes the estimate of 
ivealth. It differentiates, according to age, the living from the dying, by enriching 
the former at the expense of the latter. Hence, from this point of view, it is evident 
that if all settlements were made just before death, the fundamental assumption, 
that the dying are a fair sample of the living, requires that the deduced amount of 
aggregate wealth in any age-group shall be corrected by adding the amount of the 
settlements at the age of the donors to the amount appearing in the probates : that 
is to say, the amoimt Ii.^s^ must be added to the deduced total wealth of those of age 
X, by way of correction (/?j. denotmg the reciprocal of the death-rate for the age in 
question, and s^ the amount of the settlements by persons of that age). 



120 The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 

Retaining the same supposition, if, also, the whole of the settlements were 
throughout proportional to the probate amounts, the general factor k could be applied 
to their sum to find the correction to the aggregate of wealth computed, without 
taking them individually into account, that is, as distributed according to age. If 
they were not substantially proportional, then the correction would be their aggre- 
gate, i.e., 2j{R^s^). This would indicate that the correction for settlements would 
be of the order kHs, or if S represents the aggregate of the settlements kS. 

Again, if all the donees, assumed to be the younger, died immediately after 
receiving a settlement, the inclusion in their probates would have the effect of unduly 
increasiwj the estimate oj wealth. For if thej^ were a years younger than the donor of 
age X, they would appear in the aggregate result as R^^g^s^, whereas, in the case of 
the donor dying, they would have appeared as R^s^, a much smaller amoimt, be- 
cause from age 12 onwards, the factors R decrease, and with growing rajoidity as age 
advances. It would thus appear that a correction of the amomit 27(i?j._(,Sj.) must 
always be an excessive one. The correction U{R^s^) can hardly be an excessive 
one, and jDrobably would generally be in defect. Of coiu-se, in resjiect 
both of donors and donees it is obvious that the number of settlements will not 
coincide, case for case, with the number of deaths. For this reason it may be neces- 
sary to have regard to the effect, not only of the settlements in any current year, but 
of past settlemsnts also, in disturbing the fundamental assiunption on which the 
whole devolution-rate depends, viz., that the dying and living at any age are identi- 
cally characterised as regards wealth. In the absence of complete data, however, a 
rigorous solution is not worth attempting, and would be of little value ; it may be 
assumed that the error of adding the aggregate of the settlements to the aggregate of 
the probates will be negligible. 

Settlements are of two classes, (i.) those that come under notice and are duly 
recorded (registered settlements) ; (ii.) those which take place privately (a) by way 
of evading probate duties, (b) are informal gifts of value (i.e., are transfers of wealth 
without consideration) ; or (c) are formal gifts from " natural love and affection," 
etc. Of the recorded ones some will later fall into the probates through the death of 
the donees, and the question arises how far a deduction should be made from the 
aggregate amount of the probates by way of correction. This inquiry fails, however, 
for want of data. 

The registered settlements of New South Wales and of Victoria (the latter 
proba))ly coming into cognisanca tlirough the insolvency proceedings) are as follows :

It is evident from the amounts that they are only a very small part of the actual

In Victoria the duties collected on registered settlements ranged from i Â°q to 2^% 
in the vears mentioned below, and were as follows : â€” 



1910. 


1911. 


1912. 


1913. 


1914. 


1910-15. 


;l 1,349 


Â£16,875 


Â£14,943 


Â£17,096 


Â£14,635 


Â£14,980 (average) 



For the purpose of ascertaining approximately what sums are represented by these 
amounts of duty, a special compilation was undertaken of the major portion of the 
1914 settlements, with the following results : â€” 

Subject . . 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Whole Year 

Amount . . Â£479,094 Â£376,041 Â£320,499 Â£393,996 Â£1.569,630 

Duty paid . . Â£4,658 Â£2,935 Â£2,430 Â£3,605 Â£13,628 

Percentage .. 0.97% 0.78% 0.76% 0.92% 0.87% 



The Rate of Devolution. 121 

The amount was 115.2 times the duty paid, which gives about Â£1,72.5,700 as an 
amiual average of the settlements. Since the amiual average net wealth appearing 
in the probate returns was Â£8,25(i,640 (including absentees), this sum represents no 
less than 20.91% of the total, and cannot therefore be neglected. On the whole, 
it is thought that to incorporate the entire amount with the probate-aggregates as 
suggested, will not cause an overestimate of the wealth, indeed, in view of the fact 
that a large niunber of settlements do not come under observation at all {e.g., mar- 
riage settlements which are often considerable), it is possible that the error is one of 
considerable defect.^ We may therefore take 20.9 per cent, as the necessary cor- 
rection, and therefore 1.209 as the correction-factor for the effect of settlements, 
i.e., in Victoria, and in the absence of definite information for the rest of Australia. 

31. The distribution oÂ£ wealth among the dying, Victoria.^ â€” Victoria is the only 
State in the Australian Commonwealth which has compiled returns shewing for each 
year of age number of probates, and the net values of the States represented. 
These affoi'd the necessary indication of the variableness of the numbers and values 
for different ages, and thus they reveal one of the essential limitations of the probate 
method of estimating wealth, unless the returns are spread over a cojisiderable 
number of years or apply to a veiy large population. In the following table the 
nvimlier of deaths is given for each age, also the number of probates and the aggre- 
gate of their net values. The smoothed values of these are also given : the net 
values per probate are deduced from the smoothed results, and these values are again 
given. The ratio of probates to deaths are also given for each age. 

The numbers for each age and sex for the years 1908-1915 inclusive, are given on 
Fig. 8, see p. 134, the zigzag lines denoting the successive triennial age-means, and 
the curves giving the smoothed results for the same total. ^ 

The aggregate values of the probate estates for each age and sex are shewn by 
Fig. 9, see p. 134, the zigzag lines denoting in this case the quinquennial age- 
means. The curves are the smoothed results with the same totals.* 

Fig. 10, see p. 135, shews the average wealth per pi'obate for eacli age and sex 
on Curves A and B, the dots and crosses denoting respectively the results as given by 
the smoothed values for males and females respectively. The circles and squares are 
the qumquennial age-means of quotients obtained from the numbers and values of 
probates for three consecutive ages, attributed to the middle age. The law of in- 
crease with age in the average value of probates is thus seen not to be very definite. 

Curves C and D, on Fig. 10, shew for males and females respectively the ratio of 
probates to deaths according to age. The dots shew the values deduced for the 
smoothed results. The smoothed results, agreeing therewith, are denoted bj^ the 
continuous curves : the general indication of these are shewn l)y the more regular 
broken curves, marked C ' and D '. 

In tlie following table the data are given on which eacli of the curves refeired to 
is based, as also the smoothed results obtained therefrom : â€” 



1. The essence of the question is as follows : â€” Consider a population porfoctly homosoneous in 
respect to the dying and livins as regards the distribution of wealtli according to age â€” a population in 
which no settlements have taken jilace. When, in such a population, a jhtsou of any given age makes 
a settlement on another (of the same or some other age) the effect is to disturb the pre-existing homo- 
geneity. When the donor dies his estate will ))e in defect, while the estate of the donee, if living, will 
be in excess. Hence, when the donor's estate is nniltiplied by the ratio of the living to the (lying, it 
would not even represent (if the donee were of the same age) the wealth of the living irrespective of the 
increa.se due to the settlement. 

This point of view takes no account, however, of the rate of growth of wealth from the point of 
time at which the sit t lenient was made, or of tlie possible fact that the rate of growth may itself 
possil)ly be an ascertainable function of age. and may not be a question merely of aconnulation accord- 
ing to the general rate of interest. In fact, there is reason to believe that tlicratc of increase of wealth 
is appreciably greater for the period 48 to 5.") years of age (for males) than for any other jteriod. 

2. The ordinates to the curves at the middle of the year-ranges give the number for the partic\ilar 
year of age in ciuestion. 

3. The results for individual years of age are so irregular that it was preferable to take tiie mean of 
5 consecutive years of age and attribut* them to the middle year of age.

The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns. 



32. Distribution according to age probably not constant. â€” In order to obtain 
the values in the table of Â§ 25, a constant relative distribution of aggregate wealth 
according to age-groups was assumed. Such constancy is, however, improbable. 
We may now consider the question further. If the ratio of the number of probates 
to the total number of persons dying in a given age-group be constant from year to 
year, and the death-rate in that age-group be also constant, it will follow as a 
consequence that the numbers of probates will vary from year to year as the 
numbers living in the given age-group of the jjopulation, and if at every date the 
average wealth for that group be relatively the same (i.e., similarly related but 
not necessarily identical in amovuit) the aggregate amounts of the probates in that 
age-group will vary as the numbers ; in short, the wealth in any age-group will vary 
with the population in that group. Thus, if we have the absolute or relative con- 
stitution according to age of the population at two dates, i.e., if we have for each 
date, either 

(.32) P = Pj -f P,^ + etc., ov \ -= p^ + p^ + etc., 

we can deduce for one date the probate distribution of the relative amovmt of the 
probates from the given distribution at the other date. As in Chapter II. of this 
part, let Ux, denote Wx/Sw, and in (32) above let accented quantities denote values 
at any jDarticular date, which are to be referred to a date for which the distribution 
is known, then, subject to the assumption referred to holding good, we have : â€” 



(33). 



.u'n = frUnPn/ Pn = h^hi P'n / Pr 



the constants g and h being so taken that Eu' =1.' Thus a probable distribution 
scl:ieme (series of values of %i') can be deduced, based upon known age -distributions 
of the 23opulation. Similarly, it could be based upon the ratio of the number of 
deaths occurring in the various age-groups. 

33. Correction for variations in the age-distribution. â€” From the several censuses 
the ratios of the relative distributions of population according to age ^ are as shewn 
in the following table. It will be noticed that the variations are very irregular.

1. AlthouRh P'/P is not the same quantity as p'/p {e.g., one may be greater while the other is less 
than unity), it is easily shewn that when the factors o and h are applied to their respective cases, so as 
to make the sum unity, the resultant values of u',^ are identical.

* This distribution is for tlie agfjregate of Victoria. 1908-15 ; New South Wales, 1911-15 ; and 
Queensland, 1916 ; these being the whole of the available material. The relative weights are : Males, 
1.0 ; females, 0.2368. The epoch to which the results apply is about the beginning of 1914. 

The numbers living to 1 dying have been ascertained from the 1911 Census 
Life Tables, Part XI. of the Report, vide pp. 1209-1218, and are shewn for the epochs 
1886.0, 1896.0, and 1906.0.^ By interpolation and extrapolation we obtam values 
corresponding to the middle of the census years ; and these, multiplied by the ratios 
above given, furnish the variations in the values of k for males and females. In 
order to combine these, the weights 1 and 0.2368 are used respectively for males and 
females, and in this way k is found for " persons." The R factors used were as

These ratios multiplied into the values of u' given in the preceding table, give 
the values for k (corrected for largeness of groups, see table of Â§ 5, p. 86) shewn in 
the last line. If the male results are given the weight 1 and the female the weight 
0.2368, i.e., the ratio of the probate-aggregates for males and females respectively, 
the results for " persons" are :â€” 1881, 27.60 ; 1891, 29.55 ; 1901, 30.69 ; and 1911, 



1. More strictly the mean of the periods 1881-1890, 1891-1900, and 1901-1910. 



128 The Estimatton of Wealu from Probate Returns. 

33.78, while the results given in the table of Â§ 25, p. 115, are respectively 24.05 ; 
2.657 ; 29.35 ; and 32.74. If we use the general series shewn in Â§ 25 as a basis, and 
by linear additions make the additions thereto so as to give values equal to these last- 
computed values, we obtain the results shewn in the table of Â§ 36, p. 130, herein- 
after. These have a higher probability than the factors of the table in Â§ 25. 

34. Combined corrections. â€” Owing to the fact that the data as regards jDrobates: 
are complete only for " gross vakies," and that the limitations of the data preclude 
all possibility of attainmg to precision in the estimates of total private wealth from 
probates, the practical sokition may be simiDlified. Thus it will suffice to take the 
product of the individual corrections and apply this product to the total for Australia. 
The product of the corrections for assurance for settlements and for the reduction 
of gross to net values is 0.96 x 1.209 x 0.862 = 1.0005 ; hence, we may accept the 
gross values without correction and ap^ily the values of k thereto to obtain the aggre- 
gate of the wealth. 

35. Empirical correction of probate results. â€” The question still remains to be 
settled whether probate results can be expected to agree with census results without 
further correction. As shewn on p. 28, the aggregate private wealth of Australia 
was Â£1,643,463,376. In a district whose population was 77,350, the total debt for 
males was about 0.00315 of the assets, for females about 0.00124, and for persons 
0.00260, the ratio of the numbers in debt compared with those who (as declared) 
possessed assets being respectively 0.04340, 0.01433, and 0.02978. The total number 
of returns in this district was 25,932 out of a total population (all ages) of 77,350, i.e.,. 
very slightly over one-third. See p. 34 herein. The total nimiber of " not accounted 
for" in the whole War Census was : males, 1,147,623 ; females, 1,614,461 ; or 
persons, 2,762,084. Any correction for the amount of debt referred to would be 
insensible compared with the opposite correction for shortage of returns, and may 
therefore be wholly ignored. 

The k factor for the year 1915 is 34.07 (later calcvilation, 34.99); see Â§ 25, p 115.. 
and the probate aggregate for that year (gross values) is Â£29,353,000 ; the product 
of the two is Â£1,000,057,000 (or Â£1,027,061,000); hence, to convert the probate 
estimate mto the census estimate of Â£1,643,463,376, it is necessary to multiply by 
1.6425 (or 1.600161). We could therefore apply this factor to the values of i in the 
table inÂ§ 25 (or 1.60016 to those in the later table), and thus obtam the values shewn 
in the table hereinafter ; see p. 130. 

36. The growth of Australian wealth.^ â€” In the following table are shewn the 
gross values of both the Testate and Intestate estates in Australia for the years 1878 
to 1915 inclusive. The figures for Western Australia were not available from 1878 ta 
1892, but were estimated in the following manner : â€” 

The average value of all estates in the Commonwealth (less Western Australia) 
was found for the quinquennia 1878-1882 and 1896-1900. These values were Â£1844 
and Â£2044 respectively. It was assumed that the average value of estates increased 
linearly from 1880 to 1898, the annualincrease in value being (2044- 1844)/18= Â£11.1. 
In Western Australia the average value of estates for the qumquennivim was found 
to be Â£1593. This was then reduced in the ratio of the linearly changing figures 
referred to, carrying on the change past 1880 to 1898. This method was deemed to 
be sufficiently accurate for the purpose in view. The figures for Intestate Estates. 
in Tasmania from 1878 to 1884 were computed in a similar mamier. 

Particulars of Testate and Intestate Estates in 1914 and 1915 were not given 
separately in the case of New South Wales, but the totals for all estates are given.

The Estimation or Wealth from Probate Returns. 



Re-seals and re-grants have been included in every State except Victoria, 
which includes value, but excludes the numbers, and South Australia, where second 
grants are excluded. 

Particulars relating to Intestate Estates in South Australia were not available 
till 1907. The figures from 1878 to 1906 were computed on the assumption that the 
proportion of Intestate to Testate Estates in each year from 1878 to 1906 was the 
same as the proportion of the aggregate figiu-es for 1907 to 1915. 

Applying to the quinquennial means of the aggregates the deduced factors 
referred to in Â§ 33, and the corrections referred to in Â§Â§34 and 35, we obtain the 
following results, viz. : â€”

38. Probate and general distribution of wealth according to size of estate. â€” The 

distril)ution according to size of estates, of estates api^eariiig in probate-retiu-ns, is 
not identical with a distribution for the whole community : nevertheless it could be 
ascertained if only the distributions for age-groups (within small limits of age) were 
tabulated. 

Su])pose that m^., m' ^, m y., etc., be the ninnbers of persons of age x who are 
shewn on the ])robate-returns as possessing wealth between ranges to i\ ti to u , 
v' to i" , etc., and that /?â€ž be the ratio of the livuig to the dying ( H r= the reciprocal 



The Rate of Devolution. 



131 



of the death-rate at age x, eith r a year say, or a five or ten-year range of ages). 
Then the numbers for the corresponding ranges among the living (on the assumption 
that the dying are a fair sample of the living) are R ^m^., R.^m' ,_^, R ^m ^, etc. 

If we compile for all ages the numbers in each range, we have for the dying â€” 

m^ + m^^^ + m^^2 + etc.; m ^ -f tn\^^ + m\^^ + etc. ; 



+ "^X + l + "*X+2 



etc. 



But in the corresponding compilation for the living we have, on the assumption 
mentioned : â€”

â–  {R^mj, + R

(R.J. in" 



R. 



m

4-2 



m.

-\- etc.); etc., etc. 



If the numbers between given ranges of net-values of estates for each age-group 
are kejJt, the grouping for all ages taken together can approximately be found. 
If, however, the group (for all ages) be formed from the probate-returns treated as a 
whole, one cannot obtain the general distribution by nnultiplying these by any general 
constant, as, for example, the weighted mean of R^, R^j^i, etc., say Rq, for this 
would give : â€” 

(35) {i^oÂ»>.v r i?o"ia; + i + ^o'Â«a; + 2 + etf!.) ; 

{RnÂ»i'x + ^o"i'a;-|-i + ^oÂ»i'a; + 2 + etc.); 

{Rom\ + i?oÂ»Â«'"a; + i + ^a^^' x + i + ^^c.) ; etc., etc., 
which is obviously not identical with (34) above. 

The dissimilarity of the two distributions referred to in the previous demon- 
stration is revealed by making a comparison between the results as given by the 
War Census and in the probate-returns : â€”

* Interpolated values from the Census results. 

t 21,070 cases correspond to a population of 602,243 persons ; the total population was about 
40,740,000. 

In the aVjove table the foiu-th cohnnns give the equivalent distribution of 21,070 

estates according to the War Census results. The results for Prussia appear to agree 

rather with the proViato-distribution in Victoria tlian with the census-distribution. 

39. Conclusions regarding the probate method. â€” (i.) Even when the data of a 
single year are (;t mplete, the probate method cannot be relied upon to give a satisfac- 
tory estimate of wealth existing at that year, because, whatever size the community, 
the appearance of large estates in probate-retiu-ns must necessarily bo irregular. 



132 



The Estimation or Wealth from Probate Returns. 



(ii.) Though the use of quinquennial averages diminishes this irregularity, it 
is insufficient to reduce it to an insensible amount : even the combination of the data 
for 10 years will not always effect this. 

(iii.) For precision the probate-records of each sex must be considered separ- 
ately : the use of a general multiplier is not rigorously exact. 

(iv.) To obtain results of high accuracy a record of all settlements, including all 
marriage settlements â€” which latter are rarely recorded â€” is an essential. If the 
proportion of settlements to probates be large, it is further necessary that the ages of 
donors and donees also be given, otherwise, the uncertainty of the result will be 
appreciable. The effect of settlements in distm-bing the normal distribution of 
wealth requires special investigation. 

(v.) To estimate the wealth in any age-group, the ratio of living to the dying 
should be the weighted average for the period considered, and inasmuch as this ratio 
sensibly changes from year to year, account should be taken of the change. 

(vi.) A correction is necessary in order to allow for the fact that, from the stand- 
point of averages, life insurance unduly increases the probate -return, and to that 
extent creates a wealth-differentiation between the living and dying. Existing 
statistics admit of only a rough correction. 

(vii.) Net values are necessary in all cases where precision is reqviired : it is not 
satisfactory to correct by a general factor of reduction (gross to net values). 

(viii.) Statistics are needed, to shew whether death-rates vary with the wealth of 
individuals : without this the rigour of the method is uncertain. Such statistics 
are not at present available. 

(ix.) An estimate made in respect of an average taken over a quinquennial 
or a decennial period may with advantage be ordinarily assigned to the middle of 
the period, but is not the value as at that particular date. 

(x.) In Australia the probate-method cannot lead to satisfactory results owing 
to the absence of the necessary data regarding settlements. This defect introduces 
great uncertainty into determinations from probates, a fact forcibly illustrated by 
the necessity of applying a correction-factor of about 1.6 to the resvilts obtained 
from probates, in order to bring them into agreement with the estimates obtained by 
the War Census.

tions of some of the leading features of the matter treated in the present part.

curves marked M relate to males, 
while the two lower marked F 
relate to females. As an alterna- 
tive representation for Victorian 
males a dot-and-dash line is shewn, 
which is probably a more correct 
indication of the trend than the 
closer-fitting, but wa\'y, continuous 
line. The curves are, in the 
main, based on decennial aggre- 
gates, while those shewn for Vic- 
toria in Fig. 10, on page 135, are 
based on returns for each year 
(see pp. 109, 110). 

The accompanying graph (Fig. 6) furnishes a representation of the average 
wealth per estate for each age, based upon the Victorian probate experience 
for the eight years 1908-15, 

and the New South Wales Average Wealth per Estate, 

experience for the three years Victoria, 1908-15. N.S.W., 1911-13.

sults are represented by con- 
tinuous lines, and the New 
South Wales results by 
dotted, the male and female 
results being denoted in each 
case by the letters M and 
F respectively. The small 
circles in the case of Vic- 
toria, and the dots in the 
case of New South Wales, 
indicate the position for the

PART VI.â€” THE INVENTORY METHOD OF ESTIMATING WEALTH. 



CHAPTER I.â€” ESTIMATE OF AUSTRALIAN PRIVATE WEALTH FOR 1915. 



1. General. â€” Of the various methods of estimating the weaUh of the community 
the inventory method is that which furnishes most readily a comprehensive view of 
the various classes of wealth constituting the aggregate. In this respect it has ad- 
vantages which do not attach to either the succession (probate) method or the census 
method. The possibility of using it, however, is largely dependent on the existence 
of valuations of various kmds made for purposes other than the estimation of total 
wealth, as, for example, Local Government assessments, values of imports, values 
of plant and machinery engaged in various indxistries, etc. Further, in certain of 
the items direct valuation is not possible, and estimates based on indirect data and 
general knowledge must be employed, as, for example, an estimate of the value of 
clothing based on the known number of persons, and an assumed value per head, or 
a valuation of furniture based on the number of houses of various sizes or of various 
rental values. It is thus clear that, in common with all other estimates of wealth, 
the inventory method is involved in some measure of uncertainty, but it is doubtful 
whether this is more marked than in the case of other methods. On the other hand 
it has the advantages (i.) that it enables a fair idea to be obtained of the degree of 
uncertainty involved in each item, (ii.) that unlike a censvis it costs little to compile 
and can consequently be prepared at relatively short intervals, (iii.) that it relates 
approximately to a definite point of time, whereas a " succession" estimate at its 
best can only give the average for an extensive period if it is to be at all reliable. 

2. Basis of estimate. â€” In the accompanying estimate provision has been made 
for the inclusion of all material private wealth existing in Australia, whether owned 
by persons domiciled in Australia or by those resident abroad, bvit public property 
whether national or cotnniunal has been omitted. Owing to this scheme it might 
possibly be considered necessary to mclude in the aggregate an item representing 
the securities for loans to Commonwealth and State Governments, and to public 
bodies, which are held in Australia, since such holdings will in all cases be included 
in succession returns and census results, and should thus be included to justify a 
comparison of the results obtained by the several methods. Although such inclusion 
might appear out of place in what is essentially a valuation of material objects, it 
might, perhaps, be possible to justify it on the view that the amount so included 
represents the portion of the national and communal property for which private investors 
resident in Australia hold certificates of title in the shape of bonds, debentures or 
stock. 

It is not clear, however, that a similar contention in favour of including the 
Australian public debt held outside the Commonwealth would not have equal validity. 
In view of all the circumstances it was decided to omit any reference to the public 
debt in the main estimate, but to refer to it later in making comparisons with the 
succession and War Census results. 

In broad outline the classes of private wealth contributing to the aggregate 
may be classed as follows : â€” 



Estimate of Australian Private Wealth for 1915. 



137 



(i.) Land and Improvements ; (ii.) Live Stock ; (iii.) Agricultural, Dairying 
and Pastoral Implements and Machinery ; (iv.) Manufacturing Plant and 
Machinery ; (v.) Mining Properties (including plant and machinery) ; (vi.) Coin 
and Bullion ; (vii.) Private Railways and Tramways ; (viii.) Shipping ; 
(ix.) Agricultural and Pastoral Products; (x.) Locally manufactured products; 
(xi.) Mining Products (other than gold) ; (xii.) Imported Merchandise ; (xiii.) 
Clothing and personal adornments ; (xiv.) Furniture and fittings, books, pleasure 
vehicles, etc. 



3. Details of Estimations. â€” (i.) Land and Improvements. â€” The estimate in 
respect of this item is based on the municipal valuations of the several States and 
represents about two-thirds of the total estimated wealth. The form in which this 
information would be most serviceable is that of improved capital value, but 
unfortunately particulars of this nature are available for the whole State in the cases 
of Victoria and South Australia only. Similar information in the cases of New 
Soiith Wales and Western Australia is furnished for " municipalities" onlj% the 
assessments for " shires" in New South Wales and for the majority of the " road 
districts" in Western Australia being upon an unimproved basis. In Queensland all 
the assessments are based upon unimproved values, while in Tasmania and in a few 
of the Western Australian road districts the figures given relate to " annual values." 
It is thus necessary in several cases to apply certain factors for the purpose of con- 
verting " unimproved" and " annual values" into the corresponding '" improved 
capital values." 

(a) New South Wales. â€” The valuation of the municipalities of New South 
Wales for the year ended 31st December, 1915^ furnished the following results : â€”

In the New South Wales Statistical Register for 1915 (p. 783), from which the 
valuation figures given above have been taken, the following definitions of the three 
classes of valuation are furnished : â€” 

" The Unimproved Capital Value of laud is the amoiuit which the fee simple 
estate in such land is worth under such reasoiuible conditions as a bona fide seller 
would require, assuming the actual improvements had not been made." 

â– " The Improved Capital Value is the amount which the fee simple estate of the 
land is worth, with all improvements and buildings thereon." 

" The Assessed Annual Value is nine-tenths of the fair average rental of land 
with improvements thereon." 



138 The Inventory Method op Estimating Wealth. 

The total area embraced by these municipalities is 2913 square miles, or less 
than 1 per cent, of the total area of the State, while the population contamed therein 
represented more than 64 per cent, of the total population of the State. 

With the exception of a portion of the sparsely populated Western Land Division 
the remainder of the State is divided into shires, which cover a total area of 180,655 
square miles, or somewhat more than 58 per cent, of the whole area of the State, the 
population of this portion representing nearly 35 per cent, of the total for the State. 
The unincorporated area of the Western Land Division covers an area of 125,893 
square miles, or rather more than 40 per cent, of the area of the State. Its popula- 
tion, however, is rather less than 1 per cent, of the total population of New South 
Wales. 

As regards shire valuations for 1915, the unimproved capital value is available 
in all cases, and aggregates Â£104,745,633. Improved capital values which are 
available for eleven shires aggregate Â£21,412,096, the unimproved values for the 
same shires totallmg Â£9,599,892, or 44.83 per cent, of the corresponding improved 
values. There were ten cases in which improved capital vahies and assessed annual 
values were both given, the improved values aggregating Â£18,088,565, and the corres- 
ponding assessed annual values Â£822,201, or 4.88 per cent, of the impi'oved value. 
On the assvunption that the eleven shires, quoted above as giving a percentage of 
44.83 for the ratio of unimproved to improved value, may be taken as a fair sample 
in this respect of the shires of New South Wales, the multiplier for converting the 
aggregate vmimproved value for shires into the corresponding improved value will be 
100 -T- 44.83. Applying this factor the improved capital value for shires works out 
at Â£233,650,000. It may be noted that the ratio of unimproved to improved capital 
value obtained at the War Census of 1915 for owners domiciled in New South Wales 
was 44.91 per cent. 

In the case of the unincorporated portion of the Western Land Division an esti- 
mate of Â£10,000,000 unimproved value is quoted in the Official Year Book of New 
South Wales for 1915 (p. 587), as being within reasonable limits. This estimate is 
apparently based on the assumption that an unimproved value of 2s. 6d. per acre 
might be taken as applying to the whole of the area of slightly more than eighty 
million acres contained in the Western Division. Although this estimate might be 
appropriate for certain pui"poses, it appears somewhat high for adoption in the present 
case, and it was considered desirable to prepare an estimate on the basis of the popula- 
tion of the unincorporated area taken in conjunction with the average vuiimp roved 
value per head disclosed by the contiguous shires. These are the shires of Boomi, 
Walgett, Marthaguy, Bogan, Lachlan, Carathool, Waradgery and Wakool, which in 
1915 had an aggregate population of about 21,200, and an aggregate unimproved 
valuation of Â£9,176,669, or Â£433 per head. As the population of the unincorporated 
areaof the Western Division in 1915 was about 16,000, the corresponding miimproved 
value would on this basis be Â£6,928,000. Particulars in respect of the ratio of " un- 
improved" to " improved values" are not available for this part of the State 
separately, but as it would be relatively high it has been taken at 60 per cent., giving 
an estimated improved value for the unincorporated area of Â£11,547,000. 

Combining these results, the total for the State works out as follows : â€”

This total represents an average of Â£253 per head of the mean population of the 
State for the year 1915. 



(b) Victoria. â€” In the case of Victoria the particulars available relate to improved 
capital values, and also to annual values for all local government areas. The figures 
for 1915 are as follows : â€”

With the exception of French Island in Western Port Bay, the whole of Victoria 
is under local government. The total given above (in round numbers Â£314,611,000) 
may consequently be taken as fairly i-epresenting the total value of real property 
and improvements for 1915. It averages Â£221 per head of the mean population of 
the State for that year. 



(c) Queensland. â€” The municipal valuations for Queensland relate solely to 
unimproved capital values, and are separately available for the year 1915 for the 
10 cities, 27 towns and 147 shires which amongst them comprise the whole area of 
the State. The particulars are as follows : â€”

In the absence of any valuation data for Queensland indicating the relation 
between " unimproved" and " improved" values, it is necessary to make use of the 
ratio for that State obtained from a comparison of the War Census data. The ratio 
so obtained for owners of freehold property who were domiciled in Queensland was 
48.13 per cent. This ratio relates to the State as a whole, and in view of the varying 
ratios given above on p. 137 for municipalities and shires in New South Wales, it would 
clearly be inadmissible to apply the factor separately to the figures for cities, towns 
and shires in the preceding table. Applyhig it to the total of Â£62.023,563 gives the 
improved capital value for Queensland as Â£128,867,000, averaguig Â£187 per head of 
the mean population of the State for 1915. 



(d) South Au.'itralia.- â€” In the case of South Australia the improved capital values 
and the annual values of all ratable property for the year 1915 are given separately 
for the several corporations and district councils. The details are as follows : â€”

Of the several Australian States, South Australia has by far the largest unin- 
corporated area. Thus, while corporations account for 81 square miles, and district 
councils for 45,586 square miles, the unincorporated area amounts to no less than 
334,403 square miles, or 88 per cent, of the whole area of the State. This area is, 
however, very sparsely populated, and much of it is entirely vmoccupied. At the 
Census of 1911 the total population of the unincorporated portion of the State was 
only 11,908 persons, or less than 3 per cent, of the total population of the State. 
In the area under country district councils for 1915, the average capital value of 
ratable property per head of population was approximately Â£232. Assuming this 
average to be applicable to the unincorporated area, and taking the population of 
that area at about 12,000 for 1915, the estimated improved capital value for this 
portion of the State may be set down at Â£2,784,000. 

The total for South Australia may thus be given as follows : â€”

(e) Western Australia. â€” In this State the valuations of the municipalities are 
available in respect of what are termed " Capital value, including improvements," 
and " Net Annual Value." The totals for the year ended 31st October, 1915, are 
as follows : â€”

In the case of the Road Districts which correspond approximately to the shires 
in some other States, rates are levied in part on " annual values," but mainly on 
" unimproved values," both bases being used in some districts. For the whole State 
the " annvial values" recorded for the year ended 30th June, 1915, were Â£327,709, 
while the " unimproved values" for the same year totalled Â£14,142,879. As in- 
dicated in the preceding table, the ratio of "net annual vakie" to "improved capital 
value" works out at 8.82 per cent, for extra-metropolitan municipalities in Western 
Australia, but such a ratio is certainly too high in the case of road districts. In the 
case of New South Wales the ratio for country municipalities was 7.39 per cent., 
while that ascertained for eleven shires for which the information was available was 
4.88 per cent., or about one-third less. Assuming the same relation to hold between 
the extra-metropolitan municipalities and the road districts in W^estern Australia, 
the appropriate percentage would be two-thirds of 8.82, or 5.88. It was consequently 
decided to take 6 per cent, as fairly applying to the case. At the War Census of 
1915 the ratio of " unimproved" to " improved" capital value in respect of property 
owners domiciled in Western Australia was 40.55; as this was based on a combination 
of town and country properties, it is probably too low for use in connection with 
country properties only. The factor to be applied in converting the " unimproved 
values" quoted above into " improved values" has consequently been based upon a 
ratio of 45 per cent. As a resxilt of these computations the " improved capital 
value" for road districts has been estimated at Â£36,891,000. Combining these 
results the total for Western Australia may be stated as follows, the whole of the 
State being incorporated : â€”

Â£24,921,000 


Â£36,891,000 


Â£61,812,000 



This total represents an average of Â£192 per head of the mean population of the 
State for 1915. 

(/) Tasmania. â€” In this case the municipal valuations available relate to 
'â–  annual values" only, and total Â£1,654,654 for the year 1915. For the purpose of 
estimating the corresponding improved capital values, it is necessary to use a factor 
based on the experience of other States. As indicated above, the percentages of 
assessed annual values on improved capital values averaged as follows : â€” (i.) New 
South Wales municipalities, 6.27% ; (ii.) New South Wales shires, (11 only), 4.88% ; 
(iii.) Victorian cities, towns and boroughs, 5.58% ; (iv.) Victorian shires, 5.09% ; 
(v.) South Austi-alian local governing bodies, 4.99 Â°o ; (vi.) Western Australian 
municipalities, 6.17%. In view of these residts it appears that 5^'^, which is 
practically the ratio for South Australia, might reasonably be adopted as applicable 
to the Tasmanian data. On this basis the improved capital value works out at 
Â£33,093,000, and averages Â£166 per head of the mean population of the State for 
1915. 

((/) Territories. â€” Owing to their exceptional conditions the Northern and the 
Federal Territories furnish no data relative to local government corresponding to 
that quoted above in respect of the several States. Their omission from the estimate 
for Australia would not seriously affect the total, but for the sake of completeness it 
appears desirable to include them. It has consequently been deemed appropriate 
to compute a figure based upon the population in each case, and taking an average 



142 



The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 



value per head indicated by the State estimates. In the Northern Territory the mean 
population for 1915 was 4403, while the corresponding figure for the Federal Terri- 
tory' was 2467. The average values per head of mean population disclosed above for 
the several States are as follows : â€” New South Wales, Â£253 ; Victoria, Â£221 ; Queens- 
land, Â£187 ; South Australia, Â£212 ; Western Australia, Â£192 ; and Tasmania, 
Â£166. In view of these averages it will probably be within the mark to assume an 
average of Â£150 per head for the Territories. This will give approximately Â£660,000 
for the Northern Territory, and Â£369,000 for the Federal Territory. 



(h) Commonwealth . â€” Combining the results obtained in foregoing sub-sections, 
the results for the Commonwealth may be stated as follows in thousands of jjounds :â€”

States are not directly available, but the nvimbers of each of the principal classes 
and some of the minor classes are collected annually in each State and Territory'. 
The dates to which these records relate ai"e not uniform, but in each case the figures 
used for the present purpose refer to a point of time between 30th June, 1915, and 
31st March, 1916, thus making appropriate allowance for the losses of the 1914-15 
drought. The figures so taken for the principal classes of stock are as follows : â€”

For the valuation of this stock it was decided to adopt with slight amendments 
the standard values prescribed by the Federal Taxation Department for use in the 
preparation of income-tax returns. The amendments referred to above consisted 
in (i.) the substitution of a State rate for the standard district rates for sheep and 
cattle in Western Australia, (ii.) the insertion of rates for horses and pigs in Western 
Australia, (iii.) the insertion of a rate for pigs in the Northern Territory, (iv.) the 
insertion of rates for the Federal Territory identical with those for New South 
Wales. The values so adopted were as follows : â€”

For the Commonwealth as a whole these values average Â£9 3s. lOd. per head for 
horses, Â£4 Os. 3d. per head for cattle, 10s. per head for sheep, and Â£1 lOs. 7d. per 
head for pigs. 

Of the minor classes of live stock, poultiy are the most important, but in this 
case the records are very incomplete. As the result of a census of poultry taken in 
Victoria in April, 1911, the numbers of fowls, ducks, geese and turkeys were ascer- 
tained, and these on the basis of the average market prices for that year were worth 
Â£581,766, or 36 per cent, of the average value of the poultry and eggs produced in the 
State for that year. As an estimate of such annual production is availalile for each 
State, it has been assumed that, in each case, the value of the poultrj'- as at 30th 
June, 1915, was 36 per cent, of the value of the prodiiction of poultry and eggs for 
1915. On this basis the value obtained for the poultiy was as follows : â€”

The other kinds of domestic live stock in Australia are relatively unimportant, 
and consist mainly of goats, camels, mules and donkej-s. For the purposes of the 
present estimate the values of these have been taken at 10s. per head for goats, 
Â£25 per head for camels, Â£10 per head for mules, and Â£5 per head for donkeys. On 
this basis the values for the several States and Territories are as follows : â€”

(iii.) AyricuUural, dairying and pastoral implements and machinery. â€” In all the 
States except Victoria returns are furnished annually shewing separately the value 
of implements and machinery (i.) used mainly in general agriculture, (ii.) used mainly 
in dairying, (iii.) used mainly in pastoral pui'suits, (iv.) travelhng machinery. 
Figures are also furnished in respect of the Federal Territory annually, and a return 
for the Northern Territory was supplied for the year 1912. 

The figures so available, and the relation of these values (i.) to the area under 
cultivation, in the case of agricultural and travelling implements and machinery, 
(ii.) to the number of dairy cattle, in the case of dairying implements and 
machmery, and (iii.) to the number of sheep, in the case of pastoral implements and 
machinery, are given in the following table : â€”

* For the purposes of this return cattle have been converted into their equivalent in sheep 
by multiplying by eight. 

The travelling machinery shewn in the foregoing table bemg mainly agricultural, 
its total value has been shewn in relation to the area under crop. As tlie conditions 
in respect of agricultural, dairying and pastoral pursuits in Victoria are probably 
more closely allied to those in New South Wales tlian to those in any other State, it 
has been assumed, for the purpose of estimating the total value for Victoria, that the 
values per 100 acres, etc., shewn above for New South Wales are applicable to the 
appropriate data available for Victoria. On this basis the Victorian values for 1915 
have been estimated as follows : â€” Agricultural, Â£5,278,000 ; dairyuig, Â£347,000 ; 
pastoral, Â£072,000; travelling, Â£115,000.; total, Â£fi,412,000. 

The aggregage for the Commonwealth for 1915 may thus be estimated as 

follows : â€”

Machinery, 1915.

(iv.) Manufacturing plant and machinery. â€” In all the States returns are collected 
and tabulated annually in respect of all factories, a factoiy being defined as an in- 
dustrial establishment in which four or more persons are employed or in which power 
other than hand-power is used whatever number of persons are employed. These 
returns include one relating to the approximate value of plant and machinery 
employed in such factories, and the figures for 1915 have been used for the purposes 
of the present estimate. As, however, these figures include the value of plant and 
machinery to the amount of some Â£2,237,000, employed in railway and tramway 
workshops which are mainly Government establishments, a deduction has been 
made of the whole of the value so shewn in the annual returns. This deduction is 
probably somewhat in excess for this class of establishment, as some are private 
concerns, but the excess may be considered as a set-off to the values associated 
with other Government enterprises of a minor character.

(v.) Mininrj Properties. â€” A reliable estimate of the value of mining properties 
in Australia is difficult to obtain. A careful examination of the paid-up capital and 
the dividends of such companies operating as at 30th June, 1915, disclosed the fact 
that the paid-up capital as at that date totalled Â£45,874,366, and that the dividends 
reported for the year ended 30th June, 1915, was Â£1,354,805. A similar investiga- 
tion in respect of the dividends for mines operating at 31st December, 1916, indicated 
that the total amount of the dividends paid during 1916 was Â£1,569,253. Writmg 
imder date December 1913, IVIr. R. L. Nash, in his " Australasian Joint Stock Com- 
panies Year-book, 1913-14," gives results for Australasia, which, on the deduction 
of the figiu-es stated or estimated as applicable to New Zealand, indicate for the 
Australian minhig companies a paid-up capital of about Â£50,000,000, and an annual 
dividend of about Â£3,300,000, but the period to which the data relate is not stated. 
The figures so given for paid-up capital is only about 10% in excess of that indicated 
above, but the amount of dividends shewn is much higher, exceeding bv nearlv 150Â°/ 
the amount computed for the year 1914-15, and by about 110Â°o that computed for 
1916. Probably the reduction in the amount of dividends is due in large measure 
to the dislocating effects of the war. In view of these facts, it has not been deemed 
advi.sable to attempt a valuation based on the capitalisation of the dividends. It 
may be here noted that approximate values of the mining jilant and machinorv of 
all the States except Tasmania are furnished annually by their rcsjjective Depart- 
ments of Mines. The figures given for the year 1915 for these States and for the 
Northern Territory are as follows, an estimate being included for Tasmania based 
upon returns shewing the nuniV)er of men employed, and the value of the output for 
the vear : â€”

After reviewing the evidence available, it appeared that for the purposes of the 
present estimate, the most suitable basis of computation would be one based on the 
paid-up capital, and that to allow for possible over capitalisation a deduction of 
say 10% should be made. 

On this basis the estimated values for 1915 work out as follows, the figures 
shewn for the Northern Territory being vakie of plant and machinery only : â€”

(vi.) Coin and Bullion. â€” The principal supplies of coin and bullion in Aus- 
tralia are (a) those held by the banks, (6) those held by the Commonwealth Treasiiry 
as Australian Note Reserve, (c) those held by the Mint, (//) those in the hands of the 
public. 

As I'egards the bank holdings, returns are furnished qviarterly by all the cheque- 
paying banks, shewing for each State and the Northern Territory the average for the 
quarter of the weekly holdings of coin and bullion. For the purpose of the present 
return the mean has been taken of the averages for the quarter ended 30th June, 1915, 
and of that for the quarter ended 30th September, 1915. The figures so obtained 
represent approximately the position as at 30th June, 1915. In the case of gold this 
figure may be taken as it stands, but the face-value of silver and copper coinage will 
require to be reduced by the application of a factor representing the ratio of the 
buUion valvie of the com to its face-value. Returns furnished by tlie various banks 
as at 30th June, 1916, indicate that at that date the face-value of the coin held by 
them was distributed in the following proportions : gold, 95.54% ; silver, 4.31 Â°o ; 
bronze, 0. 15%. For the year 1915 the average price per ounce of silver in the London 
market was 23ild., and as the face-value of silver coin is 5s. 6d. per ounce, the factor 
for reduction in the case of silver is approximately 0.359. On the basis of the London 
prices of June, 1915, the metallic value of the bronze comage was about 9d. per lb. 
As bronze coins having a face- value of Â£1 weigh approximately 5| lbs., on the as- 
sumption that the amounts of pence and half-pence in circulation are approximately 
equal in face value, the appropriate reduction factor in the case of bronze is about 
0.206. Takmg these factors in conjiuicl ion with the proportions of silver and bronze 
furnished above, it will be seen that the estimated banks' lioldings of coin as at 30th 
June, 1915, must be multiplied by 0.971 to reduce them to their metallic values.

Under the provisions of " The Australian Notes Act. 1910." the Commonwealth 
Treasurer was required to hold m gold coin (a) an amount not less than one-fourth of 
the amount of Australian Notes issued by the Treasurj^ up to Â£7,000,000 ; and 
{h) an amount equal to the amount of Australian Notes issued in excess of Â£7.000,000. 
By the " Austrahan Notes Act 1911," this provision was amended, and suice 1st 
July, 1912, the Treasurer has been requireil to " hold in gold coin a reserve of not 
less than one-fourth of the amount of Australian Notes issued." The amount so 
held in accordance with the Act on the last Wednesday in Jmie, 1915, was 
Â£11,034,703 10s. 

The amount held by the Mint at anj' given time is relatively unimportant. 
The accounts for the branches at Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth are made up to 31st 
December m each year, and shew in the " Bullion Account" the value of the bullion 
in store at the beguining and end of the year. For the pui-poses of the present 
estimate the mean of these for 1915 has been taken as representing approximately 
the position at the 30th June, 1915. 

The figures so obtained for the several branches are as follows : â€” Sjdney, 
Â£14,722 ; Melbourne, Â£2273 ; Perth, Â£4649. 

As regards the value of coin held by the general pul>lic. it has been assiuned that 
by the 30th June, 1915, gold had ceased to circulate, its place being taken bj- Aus- 
tralian notes. This is not strictly correct, as small amounts of gold coin were still 
in circulation at a later date. Further, there is little doubt that since the outbreak 
of war there has been a certain amount of hoardmg of gold coin. It is probable, 
however, that the amount omitted by ignoring these items is not large. In the case 
of silver and bronze coin it was estimated in 1906 by the deputy-master of the Perth 
branch of the Royal Mint that the amotuit then in circulation in the Commonwealth 
had a face value of Â£1,200,000. or. say, 5s. 1 Id. per head of population. This amount 
per capita was applied to the population of the several States and Territories as at 
30th Jtme, 1915, and an allowance was made based on the relative amounts of silver 
and bronze coin held by the banks and the ratios of metallic to face values deter- 
mined above, the assumption being made that silver and bronze coin ii\ the hands 
of the public would be in the same proportion as regards face value as was foimd 
in the case of such coin held bj^ the banks. 

On this basis the values obtained were as follows : â€”

(vii.) Private Railways and Tramways. â€” In all the States tlie principal lines of 
railway are owned and worked by the several Governments, and the majority of the 
tramways are under the control of either the government of the State or of municipal 
authorities. There are, however, in addition to the government railways upwards of 
3000 miles of privately-owned lines in the Commonwealth, much of which is used 
solely for special industrial purposes, such, for example, as coal lines in New South 
Wales, svigar lines in Queensland, and timVjer lines in Western Australia. Of the 
private lines used for general trattic, the most extensive are the Midland Railway 
(177 miles) in Western Australia, the Etheridge Railway (142|^ miles), and the 
Chillagoe Railway (102| miles) in Queensland, the Emu Bay Railway (103^ miles) 
in Tasmania, the Silverton Tramway (36 miles), and the Deniliquin-Moama Railway 
(45 miles) in New South Wales. 

Electric tramways are run by private companies at Ballarat, Bendigo, 
North Melbourne and Geelong in Victoria, at Brisbane in Queensland, and at Kal- 
goorlie and Leonora in Western Australia. In the absence of any valuations of the 
several private lines, the cost of construction has been taken as the value for the 
ptu-poses of the present return.

For the purposes of the present estimate, a request was made to some of the 
leading shipowners for an approximate value per net ton as at 30th June, 1915, 
appHcable to the vessels on the register. This information was courteously furnished 
by those applied to, the average values given per net ton being as follows : â€” Steam 
Dredges Â£95, Steam Tugs Â£300, Other Steam Vessels Â£32, Sailing Vessels fitted with 
auxiliary power Â£27, Other Sailing Vessels Â£10, Barges, Hulks, Dredges, etc, not 
self-propelled, Â£12. On the basis of these averages the value of the shipping on the 
register was computed, en the assumption that the appropriate number for 30th 
June, 1915, was the mean between the numbers on the register at 31st December,. 
1914, and 31st December. 1915. For the purposes of local allocation, the vessels 
registered in the several States and in the Northern Territory have been treated as 
domiciled therein.

(ix.) Agricultural and Pastoral Products. â€” Whatever the point of time in respect 
of which an estimate of wealth is being prepared, there will, hi any agricultural and 
pastoral community, always be a proportion of the previous season's production in 
the hands of the producers and dealers. In addition, there will usually at such a 
time be a greater or less amount of work performed, seed sown, etc., in respect of the 
succeeding harvest. In the case of Australia there is also a large value attachable to 
the wool clip, which is being shorn as at the 30th June in any year. To allow for 
these several factors, it has been assumed that the value of agricultural and pastoral 
products in the liands of producers and dealers at 30th June, 1915, plus the value of 



150 



The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 



work done, etc., for the ensuing season, may be taken at one-half the value of the 
agricultural production for 1915 plus 90% of the wool clip for that year. The 
estimate which has been made in (ii.) above in respect of sheep is so low that it must 
be treated as value " off the shears." No allowance has been made for stocks of 
tallow, skins, hides, etc., held locally. The value obtained is as follows : â€”

The Commonwealth total represents an average of Â£12 Os. 3d. per head of the 
mean population for 1915. 

(x. ) Locally Manufactured Products. â€” The value of the output of manufacturing 
establishments is collected and tabulated annually in the several States, and for th^i 
year 1915 totalled Â£169,086,700 for the whole of Australia. Of this, however, the 
railway and tramway workshops which are largely owned by various Govern- 
ments are responsible for Â£6,046,521 in all (see item iv. above). This amount has 
consequently been deducted to reduce the total to a "private" basis in each State. 
For the piu-poses of the present estimate it has been assumed that one-sixth of the 
year's output would be in the hands of merchants and dealers at 30th June, 1915, 
and that the same proportion of the year's total would be in the hands of the manu- 
facturers in the form of (a) completed articles, (b) partly manufactured goods, or 
(c) raw materials. Tlie estimate for the holdings of all parties will thus be 
as follows : â€”

The Commonwealth total represents an average of Â£10 19s. 7d. per head of the 
mean population for 1915. 

(xi.) Minim/ Products (other than Gold). â€” Many of the products of mining in 
Australia are in the hands of maniifacturers and banks, or are exported at a relatively 
early date after their extraction. This is particularly the case with gold. Probably 
the mineral most extensively held after extraction and before manufactiu-e, con- 
sumjJtion, export, etc., is coal. In the United States estimate for the year 1912, it 
was assumed that at 31st December, 1912, a quantity of coal equalto the wholeof that 
mined during 1912 was in hand. Such an estimate would be much too high for 
Australia. For the purpose of the present estimate, it has been assumed that at 
30th June, 1915, no gold was in the hands of the mining companies, and that the value 
of the other minerals so held was one-sixth of the total production of such minerals 
for the year 1915. Returns of the quantity and value of all minerals produced are 
t;ollected and published annually by the Mines Departments of the several States.

The total for the Commonwealth represents an average of 9s. 6d. per head of the 
mean population for 1915. 

(xii.) Imported Merchandise. â€” During the year ended 30th June, 1915, the total 
oversea importations of merchandise into Australia were valued at Â£63,563,781. 
For the purposes of the present estimate it has been assumed that at 30th June, 1915, 
the vahie of such merchandise in bonded warehouses, and in the hands of traders, 
was one-half of the total value, or in round numbers Â£31,782,000. Owing to the 
absence of interstate trade statistics, it is impossible to accurately allocate these 
importations to their States of ultimate destination. Figures are available shewing 
the values of oversea merchandise directly delivered in each of the States, but as 
certain of the States, more particularly New South Wales and Victoria, import 
extensively for the purpose of subsequent distribution to other States, it is clear that 
an estimate based on direct importation oversea would misrepresent the ultimate 
distribution. The total of Â£31,782,000 mentioned above has consequently been 
allocated to the several States and Territories on a population basis, the results 
being as follows : â€”

(xiii.) Clothing and Personal Adornment. â€” ^Under this head may be included all 
articles of wearing apparel, watches, jewellery, etc., in the hands of the public. 
Articles of this nature in bonded warehouses or in the hands of traders have been 
already accounted for under preceding heads. The item is one of some importance, 
but unfortunately there are no means readily available for making a reliable estimate 
of the value involved. It has consequently been assumed that an average of Â£3 per 
head of the mean population for 1915 might be taken as a figiu-e which at all events 
does not exaggerate the position. The result so obtained is as follows : â€”

The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 



(xiv.) Furniture and fittings, books, pleasure vehicles, &c. â€” Under this head an 
estimate is given in respect of (i.) household furniture and fittings, (ii. ) books, (iii.) 
motor cars and other vehicles used for purposes of pleasure, (iv. ) musical instruments, 
(v.) sewmg machines, (vi.) kitchen utensils, (vii. ) fanoygoods, etc., etc. As in the 
<;ase of the preceding item, the materials available for an estimate are meagre. It 
is evident, however, that the wealth represented by the items coming under this 
head must be considerable. 

The estimate was made in the following manner : â€” The Census of 3rd April, 
1911, furnished the number of dwellings, "private" and "other than private," 
according to the number of rooms, and according to the rental paid. The numbers 
were as follows : â€”

One estimate was made of the average amount of fiu-nitvu-e, etc., necessary for 
â– " private" and " other than private" dwellings, according to the number of rooms in 
the dwelling, and a second estimate was made on the basis of the rental paid. These 
estimates were applied to the data for each State, and means were taken. ^ It was 
assumed that the value could on the whole be taken as two-thirds of the value of 
new furnitiu'e. On dividing by the number of houses at the time of the census, and 
also by the population, the results obtained as indicated were as follows : â€”

Estimate of Aistralian Private Wealth for 1915. 



153 



The total for the Commonwealth represents an average of Â£15 lis. 6d. per head 
of the mean population for 1915, or Â£74 8s. 9d. per occupied dwelling on the 1911 
census average of 4.78 inmates per occupied dwelling. 



4. Aggregate of detailed estimates. â€” On combining the detailed estimates given 
in the preceding section, tlie total value of private wealth existing in Australia, ex- 
clusive of private interests in national and comInm^al property, is found to be ap- 
proximately 1620 millions sterling, or Â£.327 per head of the mean population 
of the Commonwealth for 1915. As pointed ovit in section 2 of the present Chapter,, 
a comparison of this estimate with one based on a wealth census or on probate re- 
turns is not satisfactory unless there be added to the inventory estimate an allowance 
for the local holdings of Commonwealth, State and Municipal securities, all of which 
are brought to accoiuit in the census and probate methods. At the 30th Jrnie, 1915, 
the total amoimt so held was approximately 140 millions sterling, making with the 
smn quoted above, a total of 1760 millions as compared with the war census total of 
1643 millions, and an estimate on the probate basis of little more than 1000 millions. 
In view (i.) of the emergency nature of the war census, (ii.) of the evidence of incom- 
pleteness furnished by the returns, and (iii.) of the tendency for persons ftirnishing 
such returns to suspect taxation, and hence to furnish a conservative estimate, it is 
probable that the War Census total is an imderstatement of the position. 

It will thus be seen that the result obtained by the inventory method, although 
much in excess of any previous estimates, is in the main corroborated by the wealth 
census result. A summary of the values obtained is fiirnished in the following 
table :- â€” â–

154 The Inventory ISIethod or Estimating Wealth. 

For the sake of avoiding any possible misunderstanding of the significance of the 
above figures, it may be well to again state here that what they represent is an esti- 
mate of the value of all the private material wealth existing in Australia at :iOth 
June, 1915, whether such wealth was owned by Australian residents or not. Pro- 
perty situated outside Australia but owned by Australian residents is not included, 
and immaterial wealth such as title deeds, mortgage deeds, debentures, etc., is not, 
as such, included at all, the estimate being based entirely on the material private 
wealth itself, not in any way upon the individual titles thereto. National wealth in 
the sense of the property of Commonwealth and State Governments, and communal 
wealth in the sense of the property of the variovis local governing bodies, are not 
included, nor has any allowance been made for the fact that private investors are to a 
very large extent monetarily interested in such property in consequence of advances 
made by them by way of public and municipal loans. An estimate of the value of 
national and commmial property has not, on the present occasion, been undertaken. 
One of the large items is the Government Railways and Tramways, and the Municipal 
Tramways, whose cost of construction and equipment to 30th Jime, 191.5, was about 
Â£200,000,000. These, together with public buildings and their sites. State and 
mvmicipal industrial undertakings, and some other branches of national and com- 
munal property, are of covirse capable of approximate valuation, but there are in 
addition such items as (i.) unalienated crown lands, (ii.) streets, roads and bridges, 
(iii.) harbours, etc., for which it would be difficult to devise a suitable valuation 
basis. 



CHAPTER II.â€” EARLIER AUSTRALIAN INVENTORY ESTIMATES. 



1. Estimate for 1890 and earlier years. â€” The earliest estimate of this nature 
made in respect of Australia appears to be that made in 1892 by Mr. (now Sir) T. A. 
Coghlan, who, at the time, was Government Statistician of the State of New South 
"sVales. Particulars of this estimate were embodied in a paper read before the Aus- 
tralasian Association for the Advancement of Science at its Hobart session in 1892, 
and were svabsequently published in the 1892 issue of Coghlan's " Seven Colonies of 
Australasia." The estimate relates not only to Australia, but includes figures for 
New Zealand, and also furnishes aggregates but not details in respect of Australasia 
for 181.3, 1838, and 1 8()3. As the settlement of New Zealand in a permanent manner 
dates from 1840, the figures for 1813 and 1838 are necessarily purely Australian, 
while for 1890 the estimate for New Zealand is shewn in detail. In the case of 1863, 
however, the only figures furnished are those relating to " Australasia." For the 
purpose of comparing the Australian figures for the several years mentioned, it has 
been assumed here that in the estimate for 1863 the private wealth per head of 
population was the same in New Zealand as in Australia. With this adjustment 
Coghlan's estimate of private wealth in Australia for the years in question may be 
stated as follows, the average amount per head of mean population being also shewn :

* Adjusted. See preceding paragraph. 

In later issues of " The Seven Colonies of Aiistralasia," the figures for 1890 have 
been omitted, and an estimate for 1888 has been substituted, presumably with the 
object of making equal intervals of 25 years between the successive estimates. 
The figures, however, are given for " Australasia," not for the Commonwealth and 
New Zealand separately. The total shewn is Â£1,015,000,000, or Â£154,434,000 less 
than the â€¢" Australasian" total for 1890. Assuming this rate of reduction to have 
applied equally to Australia and New Zealand, the Commonwealth figure for 1888 
would work out at about Â£885,000,000, or Â£302 per head of mean population. 

The following table shews the estimate under eight classes of private wealth 
for Australia as a whole, particulars having been added shewing the relative size of 
each class, and the amount per head of mean population : â€”

2. Estimates for 1903 and earlier years. â€” Furtlier estimates of the private 
wealth of A\istralasia were prepared by Coghlan in respect of the years, 1899, 
1901 and 1903, and published in his "Seven Colonies of Australasia," and his 
" Statistical Account of Australia and New Zealand." The particulars in 
respect of the method of estimating are less complete than is the case with the 
estimate for 1890, but evidently they were made upon principles very similar 
in character. For the purposes of the present review it will bo sufficient to 
consider in detail the latest of these, viz., that for 1903. The classes of 
wealth adopted differ slightly from those used in the 1890 estimate, the 
main alteration being the separation of " Land" from " Houses and Permanent 
Improvements," and the separation of " Personal Effects" from " Furniture and 
Household (Joods and Effects," thus increasing the number of classes to ten in place 
of the eight classes used in the estimate for 1890. The other classes were in some

'\Vith the (>xception of three items, viz., (a) Merchandise, etc., (h) Ship])ing, and 
(c) Plant, Machinery, etc., the aggregate estimates for 1003 fell short of the cor- 
responding items for 1890, the princiyial shortage being a decline of Â£37,359,000 in 
the estimated value of "land, liouses and permanent improvements." For all classes 
â– of wealth combined the estimate for 1903 fell short of that for 1890 by Â£37,263,000. 



Comparison of Earlier Estimates with those for 1915. 157 

On the other hand the estimate for 1915 shews in every item a substantial 
advance on that for 1903. The largest increase is that of Â£421,693,000 in the value 
of " land, houses and permanent improvements," while for all classes of wealth an 
advance of Â£637,538,000 is shewn. 

Comparing the estimate for 1915 with that for 1890 there is in evidence an in- 
crease in every item except that of live stock, the total increase shewn for the 25 
years being Â£600,275,000. 

As a partial explanation of the decline in estimated values between 1890 and 
1903, it may be pointed out that the year 1890 occurred near the apex of a period of 
exceptional and to some extent perhajDs fictitiovis prosperity, and that in conseqtience 
prices, and especially the prices of real estate, were in an inflated condition. The 
subsequent collapse, followed and accentuated by the banking crisis of 1893, and 
supplemented by a series of unfavourable seasons, produced a condition of depression 
which was only slightly relieved by the discovery and development of the Western 
Australian Goldfields during the years 1893-1897. The outcome was that the prices 
of commodities fell rapidly, and the fall in the prices of real estate was even more 
marked. A further unfavourable influence in the case of 1903 was the fact that in 
the season 1902-3 Australia experienced one of its most severe droughts. 

In the case of 1915 it should be noted that since 1896 there has been a fairly 
continuous upward trend in the world's prices for practically all commodities, 
accompanied in Australia by a marked recovery in the values of real estate. This 
rise in the prices of commodities has been very marked since 1905, and has in recent 
years been accentuated by the outbreak of war in 1914.

The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 



An interesting feature of this comparison is the very high proportion in each 
case which is represented by property in the form of " land, houses, and permanent 
improvements," ranging from 70.77 per cent, in the 1890 estimate, to 68.27 per cent, 
in that for 1915. 

Threeof the items, viz., (i.) land, etc., (ii.) live stock, and (iii.) mining properties, 
occupied positions of diminishing relative importance at the successive estimates. 
On the other hand, three items, viz., (i.) merchandise, etc., (ii.) shipping, and (iii.) 
plant, machinery, etc., occupied positions of increasing relative importance. In the 
case of the two remaining items, viz., (i.) coin and bullion, and (ii.) household furni- 
ture, etc., the estimates indicated an initial decrease, and subsequent increase in 
relative importance, the variation in the case of coin and bullion being very smalL 
In the main it may be said that the figures indicate a decline in the relative import- 
ance of the primary sources of wealth, and an increase in the relative importance of 
the accumulated products of industry in the shape either of goods available for con- 
sumption or of mechanical and other aids to production. 

With the excaption, however, of the relative increases in the items "merchandise,, 
etc.," and "plant, etc.," and the relative decreases in the item "live stock," the 
variations were not verv marked. 



3. Private wealth per head in each class. â€” ^ Another comparison of importance in 
this matter is the amount per head of mean population for the years in question,, 
represented by the several items. This is furnished in the succeeding table : â€” 

Private Wealth per Head of Mean Population, 1890, 1903 and 1915.

In all the items except that of " merchandise, etc.," tlie estimate per head for 
1903 is below that for 1890, the most extensive decline being in the case of "" houses, 
etc." "Livestock," "coin and bullion," "household furniture, etc.," and "mines," 
also shew substantial shortages, the total per head for 1903 falling short of the 1890 
estimate by Â£7.5 16s. 8d. 

On the other hand the 191.5 estimate per head exhibits advances on that for 1903 
in all the items except Hve stock, the total per head giving an advance of Â£74 18s. lOd. 

Compared with the estimate per liead for 1890, that for 1915 shews decreases in 
four items, viz., " land, etc.," " live stock," " coin and Ijullion," and " mines," while 
it exhibits increases in the other four items. For a reference to the causes tending to 
produce these fluctuations see p. 157. 



Estimates of National Wealth of United States of America. 159 

CHAPTER IV.â€” ESTIMATES OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. 



1. General. â€” The following particulars exhibiting the methods and the results 
of estimates of the wealth of the United States of America have, in the main, been 
taken from the publications of the Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 

2. Census of 1850. â€” The first effort of the Government to obtain a statement of 
the valuation of the property of the comitry was made under the Census Act of 1850. 
The instructions on the schedules issued to United States marshals, through whom 
the census statistics for that year were collected, required those officers to obtain 
statistics of the valuation of real and personal property as assessed for taxation, 
and ill addition thereto the true valuation of such property. For obtaming this latter, 
the schedules contained the following instructions : â€” 

'â–  The true valuation of all jiroperty should be estimated at what is its cash 
value in the place where it is situated. In some places, however, it is valued by 
appraisers at two-thirds or one-half of its just value, and the assessment made 
upon such valuation. If in the estimate of an estate it is valued at other than 
its true worth, the trvie valuation should be stated, which may easily be done by 
adding the proper per centiun to the recorded valuation."' 

No valuation statistics of the above character were published in the final report 
of the Census of 1850, but a preliminary report by the Superintendent, which was 
published as a Congress Paper, contained a table of such values under the heading 
â– ' real and personal estate," with the following remark : â€” 

'â–  The table of real and personal estate owned by individuals is made up 
from official returns of property for taxation. Where the assessment has been 
made on a sum less than the intrinsic worth, the assistant marshals were in- 
structed to add the necessary percentage. For the purposes of taxation the 
full amount is not generally given, in rural districts especially. Stocks or 
bonds owned by the States or by the General Government are not represented. 
The value of slaves is included." 

The table mentioned is headed "' valuation of real and personal estate of the 
inhabitants of the United States for the year ending 1st Jime, 1850," and the total 
true or estimated value is giv^en as $7,135,780,228 (= Â£1,466,000,000 approximately, 
i.e., on the basis of 84.86?* to the Â£). 

3. Census of 1860. â€” At the Census of 1860 the marshals of the United States 
were directed to obtain from the records of the States and Territories respectively, 
an account of the value of real and personal estates as assessed for taxation. In- 
structions were given these officers to add the proper amounts to the assessment, so 
that the return should shew the true value as well as the inadequate .lum generally 
attached to the property for taxation purposes. The aggregation of these returns 
indicated that the value of individual property in the States and Territories amounted 
to 816,159,616,068 (= Â£3,320,000,000 approximately, at $4.86-5 to the Â£). 

In the returns for 1850 and 1860 the value of all taxable property was retiu-ned, 
including that of foreigners and non-residents, as well as that of natives and residents, 
while all property belonging to the State or Federal Government was excluded. 



160 The Inventory Method of Estiviati.vg Wealth. 

i. Census of 1870.^Iii 1870 the duty of ascertaining the assessed and true 
valuation of property was again entrusted to the United States marshals. The 
point? particularly dwelt upon in the instructions from the Census Office were : â€” 

(i.) the undervaluation of real estate in assessments for taxation ; 
(ii.) the large class of personal property lawfully exempt from taxation ; 
(iii.) the class disregarded by assessors ; 
(iv.) the class which by evasion or fraud escapes taxation. 

In the report dealing with this census, it is stated that " for the majority of the 
States and for the vast majority of the property of the country, the additions to be 
made to assessed values on account of the undervaluation of real estate has been calculated 
with great nicety by competent investic/ators.'" The report admits, however, that no 
such accurate methods could be applied to make good the shortages due to exemp- 
tions or escape of personal property from taxation in 1870, and states that the result 
reached must be characterised rather as an impression than an opinion. The 
estimated true value of all taxable property was given for 1870 on a gold basis as 
$24,054,814,806 (= Â£4,940,000,000 approx., at $4.86| to the Â£). 

o. Census of 1880. â€” At the Census of 1880 a special effort was made to intro- 
duce an initial correction into the statistics of the assessed valuation of real estate. 
With this object a circular letter was addressed from the Census Office to a very large 
number of bankers, real estate agents, and business men, as well as public officials 
connected more or less directly with the valuation of property for the piu-poses of 
taxation. The letter enclosed a form of report drafted for the piu-pose of obtaining 
an explicit statement of the methods of procedure adopted in the various localities 
in connection with the valuation of real estate. The main object of the inquiry was 
that of ascertaining for the different classes of real estate the percentage of assessed 
value to real value in the different localities. 

Over 25,000 replies to the circular were received, the majority of them exliibiting 
both a disposition to assist, and also a fair comprehension of the purpose of the 
inquiry. 

From an analysis of the data so obtained, it was ascertained that the ratios of 
assessed to true valuation of real estate ranged from 40 to 100 per cent., with an 
average for the country as a whole of 65 per cent. The percentage was in general 
found to be highest in those States having a large urban population, and least in the 
rapidly-growing States of the Upper Mississippi Valley. 

On previous occasions the estimates had related to taxable property only, but 
at the Census of 1880, and those taken subsequently, an estimate was also made of 
the value of property exempt from taxation, consisting mainly of the property of 
Federal, State and Local Governments, and of religious, charitable and educational 
institutions. 

In the reports dealing with the censuses subsequent to that of 1880, the esti- 
mated values of taxable and exempt property are shewn separatelj% but in that of 
the 1880 Census the figures given relate to taxable and exempt property combined. 
In 1890 the estimate for exempt property represented 5.9% of the combined total, 
the corresponding percentage in 1900 being 7, while in 1904 it was 6.4%, and in 
1912, 6.6%. The combined total value for taxable and exempt property ascer- 
tained at the Censas of 1880 was $43,642,000,000 (= Â£8,968,000,000 at $4. 86s to 
. the Â£).

6. Census of 1890. â€” At the Census of 1890 inquiries were sent to county and 
municipal officers asking them to state what, in their opinion, was the relation be- 
tween the assessed and the true vahie of the real estate as respectively assessed V>y 
them. To corroborate the reports fiu-nished by these officers, upwards of 25,000 
inquiries were sent throughout the country to persons believed to be familiar with 
the values of real estate, asking their opinion as to the relation between the assessed 
and true value in their respective localities. The replies received were considered 
in connection with the reports of the assessors. The value of farm lands as reported 
by the censiis enumerators was also taken into consideration. 

The estimated vahie of property for the Census of 1890 was $65,037,091,197, 
comprising taxable property $61,203,755,972, and exempt property $3,833,335,225. 
Again, taking $4.86fs to the Â£, these may be represented approximately by taxable 
property Â£12,577,000,000, and exempt property Â£788,000,000, giving a combined 
total of Â£13,365,000,000. 

7. Census of 1900. â€” (i.) General. â€” The volume relative to wealth, debt and 
taxation issued by the Bureau of the Census, Washington, in connection with the 
Censtis of 1900, contains the results of two estimates of wealth, one in respect of the 
year 1900, the other in respect of the year 1904. The former of these was authorised 
by the Act of 3rd March, 1899, providing for the Twelfth Census, the latter by the 
Act of 6th March, 1902, establishing the permanent Census Office. In both cases the 
particulars published relate to continental United States, that is, they are exclusive 
of Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. 

(ii.) Farm and Factory Property. â€” For the year 1900 Congress specifically 
authorised and directed that the value of property employed in agriculture and manu- 
factures as appraised by owners, occupiers or managers thereof should be ascer- 
tained through the agency of census eniunerators. The values so determined for 
this class of property are shewn in the following table :â–  â€” â€¢

The conversion in this table from American to British currency has been made 
on the basis of $4,863 to the Â£. 

The farm and factory total, however, constituted but a small part of the 
tangible wealth of the United States, and represented less than 29 per cent, of the 
total estimated wealth of all kinds for 1900. 

(iii.) Taxable Real Property. â€” For the value of property other than that con- 
nected with farms and factories, estimates of various kinds were employed. The 
most important single class of property outside those mentioned above was taxable 
property used for residential and business purposes, and for mines and quarries. 



162 The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 

No complete appraisal of taxed real property had ever been made in the United States 
except by assessors for purposes of taxation, and as the Census Act did not authorise 
the collection by census enumerators of such information for property other than that 
connected with farms and factories, the lists prepared by the taxation assessors 
were used as the basis for estimating the other kinds of real estate. For the purposes 
of this estimate an endeavour was made to ascertain the percentage of true value 
represented in each case by the assessed valuation, and the Bureau of the Census 
sought to utilise all the available information relating to the subject. The means 
adopted comprised (i.) the comparison of farm values collected by the census 
enumerators with assessed values for the same properties ; (ii.) the comparison 
of selling prices with assessed values ; (iii.) inquiries made by agents of the Bureau 
of the Census in practically all cities, villages and county seats from persons com- 
petent to give information relating to the ratio between the assessed valuation and 
the true value of real property ; (iv.) reports of such ratios given in financial pub- 
lications ; (v.) reports of State tax commissions and State equalisation boards. 

(iv.) Exempt Real Property. â€” In estimating the value of real property exempt 
from taxation, great difficulty was experienced in all cases except New York, Massa- 
chusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 

In the majority of cases the estimates of the value of exempt real property were 
prepared by using information secured from a number of sources, comprising amongst 
others :â–  â€” (i.) Special inquiries by census agents ; (ii.) special returns supplied by 
city authorities ; (iii.) special returns from churches, schools and kindred institu- 
tions ; (iv.) a uniform rate of $1.25 ( = 5s. 2id.) per acre assigned to the imappropriated 
and reserved domain of the United States outside of Indian Territory and Oklahoma ; 
(v.) in the two Territories mentioned a value equal to that assigned by farmers 
who, as lessees, used it for agricultural purposes. 

(v.) Live Stock. â€” On 1st June, 1900, the census eniunerators recorded the 
number and value of the various classes of domestic stock on farms, and the value of 
poultry and bees on farms. They also recorded the numl^er, but not the value, of 
domestic stock not on farms. These latter were valued on the assiunption that the 
average value of each class of stock was the same as that ascertained for farms. 
Poultry and bees not on farms were not recorded. 

(vi.) Farm Implements and Machinery. â€” The figures given under this head for 
1900 are those reported by the census eniunerators in respect of farm implements 
and machinery on farms at 1st June, 1900. 

(vii.) Manufacturing Machinery, Tools, and Implements. â€” The values of manu- 
faoturing machinery, tools, and implements for 1900 were reported by the Census of 
Manufactures for that year. The census was practically for the calendar year 1899, 
and the value returned for manufacturing machinery, tools, and implements is 
therefore the value at the close of that year, or about 1st January, 1900, not 1st 
June, 1900. No allowance for this fact was made in the final table, which conse- 
quently, owing to increases between 1st January and 1st June, tends to under- 
estimate the value. 

(viii.) Oold and Silver Coin and Bullion. â€” The estimate used for these was 
based upon the reports of the Director of the Mint, and of the Comptroller of the 
Currency for the year 1900. 

(ix.) Railroads and their Equipment. â€” An extensive valuation of the railroads 
and their equipment was made for the year 1904 by capitalising the net earnings of 
individual railways and railway systems. To obtain figures for 1900, computations 
were made to ascertain approximately the increase from 1900 to 1904, and the 
figures for 1904 were reduced in accordance therewith. 



Estimates of National Wealth of United States of America. 163 

(x.) /Street Railways, etc. â€” The value of street railways was obtained by methods 
substantially the same as those adopted for estimating the commercial value of rail- 
roads, and the same is true in a general way of the estimated value of telegraph and 
telephone systems. The value of canals was assumed to be the same as that reported 
at the Census of 1890. The value of shipping was obtained by multiplying the ton- 
nage afloat by the building cost per ton as reported by the 1900 Census of Manu- 
factures, and deducting one-third for depreciation. To this was added the reported 
cost of the ships of the United States Navy in active commission. 

The values of electric light and power stations are based upon the cost of con- 
struction as estimated for the year 1902, with a deduction of twice the cost of new 
construction during 1902. 

As privately -owned gas-works had already been included with factories, no 
special estimates were made for them. 

(xi.) Products of Agriculture, Manufactures, and Mitiing.- â€” The value assigned 
to agricultural products was one-half the value of the crops reported by the Census 
of Agriculture as raised in the year 1899 (being the quantity estimated as still in hand 
at 1st June, 1900), plus the value of the labo\ir which had been expended to 1st 
June, 1900, on the crops of that year, and which was included in the value of the 
growing crops at that date. 

The value of the products of manufactures was based wholly on the report of the 
1900 Census of Manufactures. For the value of materials and products in the 
possession of the factories, an amount was (apparently arbitrarily) allowed equal to 
two months' " gross products" of 1900. For the manufactured goods in the posses- 
sion of merchants, an amount was allowed equal to one-half the annual " net 
products " of the factory output, exclusive of hand trades. 

The value of the products of mines and quarries was based upon the census 
report for mines and quarries for 1902, taken in conjimction with the reports of 
Geological Survey for the years 1900 and 1902. 

In the case of imported merchandise it was assumed that the value of the im- 
ports either in bonded warehouses or in the hands of traders on 1st June, 1900, was 
equal to one-half the value of all such goods imported into the United States during 
the year ended 30th June, 1900. 

(xii.) Clothing, Furniture and Kindred Personal Property. â€” The estimated 
value of clothing and personal adornments, including watches, jewellery, etc., con- 
sisted substantially of the amounts which, on the basis of the 1900 Census of Manu- 
factures and the import returns for 1900, it was estimated that the people of the 
country expended for clothing and personal adornment for that year. An addition 
of one-third was made to allow for the increase in value due to the cost of transporta- 
tion and for the profit of the middleman. A small fiu-ther addition was made to 
allow for the value of the work in homes in converting cloth into clothing. 

In estimating the value of such articles as furniture for houses and public build- 
ings, books in libraries, carriages, bicycles, automobiles, harness, saddles and all 
kindred articles other than clothing, it was loosely estimated that the value of all 
these articles in the possession of the people or in public buildings was equal to four 
years' purchases of the same articles. The probable cost of four years' purchases 
was then estimated from the value of the manufactured products and imports which 
entered into the aggregate, one-third being added for the middleman's profits. 
In this connection the following account of the method adopted for valuing the cor- 
responding items at the Census of 1880 is of interest. It is taken from the report 
on that census : â€” 



164 The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 

" The number of families in each State was taken, and these were dis- 
tributed, according to the statistics of occupation, into certain characteristic 
classes. The average value of the household goods in the families of each class 
was then estimated as thoughtfiilly as possible, item by item, the values given 
to the goods representing what they were worth to the owner, or what it would 
cost to replace them, with fair allowance for wear and tear ; not what they 
would be worth to sell as second-hand goods. These results, secondly, were 
checked by an independent computation, in which the annual product or 
importation of ea<!h class of household goods, furnitvu-e, clothing, watches and 
jewellery, pianos, sewing machines, etc., was taken into account, and an average 
life in use assigned to the goods of each class. The result of this second and 
wholly independent computation was to afford a somewhat striking corrobora- 
tion of the conclusion reached by the first method. Allowance was then made 
on account of the average quantity of food, fuel and other supplies on hand for 
domestic use." 

In the report of the Census of 1890, the corresponding estimate on that occasion 
is stated to have been made as follows : â€” 

" Of the miscellaneous, the value of furnitiu-e and personal belongings 
constitutes a large portion. To arrive at the value of such property an examina- 
tion was made of more than 8000 insurance policies on contents of houses not 
located in large cities, and the result shewed the average value of furniture 
insured in such houses to be $387. The value of private carriages and tools of 
mechanics is not known, but it is believed that for each house in the United 
States there would be of furniture, tools, and carriages an average amoxint of 
$400." 

(xiii.) Aggregate for 1900. â€” The total estimated value for 1900 was 
$88,.517, 306,775 (= Â£18,188,000,000 approx., at $4.86| to the Â£). The sterling 
values of detailed items for 1900 will be found in the table on page 167 in conjunction 
with corresponding figures for 1904 and 1912. 



8. Estimate for 1904. â€” In preparing an estimate of the national wealth of the 
United States of America for 1904, the Bureau of the Census followed as far as possible 
the same procedure as was followed in the case of the estimate for 1900. The census 
returns in respect of farm property, which were used in the 1900 estimate were, 
however, lacking in the estimate for 1904, except in respect of the State of Iowa, for 
whioli a censvLs of agricultvu"e was available for 1905. For this State an estimate for 
1904 was prepared on the assumption that four-fifths of the increase recorded be- 
tween 1900 and 1905 had accrued by 1904. A similar assumption was made in 
respect of manufacturing machinery, tools, and implements, a Census of Manufactures 
for the whole of the United States, having been taken in 1905. The total value of 
the national wealth recorded for 1904 was $107,104,211,917 (= Â£22,008,000.000. at 
$4,863 to the Â£). 

The sterling values of detailed items for 1904 will be found in the table on page 
167 in conjunction with corresponding figures for 1900 and 1912. 



9. Estimate for 1912. (i.) General. â€” Particulars concerning the wealth esti- 
mate for 1912 have been taken from the Bulletin of Estimated Valuation of National 
Wealth, issued l)y the Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C., on 10th March, 
1915. 



Estimates of National Wealth of United States of America. 165 

(ii.) Taxable real property and iniprovements. â€” The " true" value of such real 
property was ascertained by obtaining for each of the States an estimate of the ratio 
of true value to assessed valuation, and by applying these ratios to the aggregate 
assessments of the several local authorities. The data obtained indicated that the 
percentage of assessed valuation of real property and improvements on the true value 
varied for the year 1912 from 11.7% for Iowa, and 15% for Nebraska, to 100Â°o for 
New Hampshire and Wyoming. 

(iii.) Exempt real property and improvements. â€” For an estimate of the value of 
exempt property it was assumed that on the average such property amounted to 
one-eighth of the value of the taxed real property and improvements. This pro- 
portion was based on an examination of the returns for the States of New Jersey, 
New York and Ohio, and the District of Columbia, which were the only official 
returns shewing the valuations of exempt property. 

(iv.) Live stock. â€” The valuations of the principal classes of domestic animals on 
farms were taken from the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for 1912, 
which gives the estimated value as at 1st January, 1913. The values of other classes 
of live stock on farms, domestic animals not on farms, and poultry and bees were 
based upon the Census report for 1909, with an allowance for increased value from 
1909 to 1912, based on the annual increase from 1899 to 1909. 

(v.) Farm implements and inachinery. â€” The estimates for 1912 were prepared by 
adding to the values reported in the Census of Manufactures for 1909, a value based 
on the average annual rate of increase from 1899 to 1909. 

(vi.) Manufacturing m,achinery, tools, and impletnents. â€” The value of manufactur- 
ing machinery, tools, and implements was not separately shewn in the returns for 
the Census of 1909, but was included with other capital. In obtaining an estimate 
for these items for 1912 it was assmned that they represented the same proportion of 
the total manufacturing capital as was ascertained for 1904. The estimated value of 
capital in 1912, including machinery, etc., was obtained by applyiixg the annual rate 
of increase from 1904 to 1909. 

(vii.) Gold and silver coin and bullion. â€” The value of gold and silver coin and 
bullion for 1912 was obtained by deducting from the total figmes of the Director of 
the Mint, the amounts held by the banks in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the 
Philippine Islands. 

(viii.) Railroads and their equipments. â€” The valuation for 1912 was obtained 
from a report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which shewed the total valua- 
tion of road and equipment for all railroads in the United States. From this total 
a reserve for depreciation of certain of the railroads was deducted. 

(ix.) Street railways. â€” The estimated value of street railways was based upon 
the cost of construction. 

(x.) Telegraph systems. â€” The estimate for telegraph systems, which was based 
upon cost of construction, includes land telegraph systems, ocean cable telegraph 
systems, and wireless telegraph systems. The value of wireless -systems was reported 
in 1912 to be $1,205,770 (= Â£248,000). No valuation for wireless systems was 
included in previous wealth estimates. 

(xi.) Telephone sy.itenis. â€” The estimate for telephone systems was based upon 
the cost of construction. 

(xii.) Pullman and other cars not owned by railroads. â€” The estimate of the value 
of these cars was based on returns furnished to the Interstate Commerce Commission. 



166 The Inventory Method of Estimating Wealth. 

(xiii.) Shipping aivd canals. â€” The estimate for mercantile shipping was based 
upon a special investigation made by the Bureau of the Census for 1906. The 
figures so obtained were brought up to date by allowances for the value of ships 
constructed from 1906 to 1912, based on the Census of Manufactures of 1904 and 1909, 
and by deductions for the value of shipping lost, etc., based on the report of the 
Bureau of Navigation for the period 1907 to 1912. 

The vessels of the United States Navy in active commission, light vessels and 
tenders of the Lighthouse Service, vessels of the Revenue-Cutter Service, and the 
floatmg equipment of the War Department were added at cost. 

The valuation of canals used for commercial purposes, or leased to railroads,, 
was obtained from various sources. The figures for State and corporation canals 
were taken largely from various State reports, and those Federal Government 
canals and canalized rivers from reports of the Chief Engineer of the United States 
Army. 

(xiv.) Irrigation enterprises. â€” These are situated in the Western States, and 
were not included in estimates of wealth for 1900 and 1904. 

(xv.) Privately -owned waterworks. â€” The value assigned to these works for 1912 
was that of 1900, with a small increase. 

(xvi.) Privately -owned central electric light and power systems. â€” The estimated 
value of these works was based upon the cost of construction. 

(xvii.) Privately -own^d gas systems. â€” The estimated value of these works was 
not separately shewn, as it has already been included in the returns of the Census of 
Manufactures. 

(xviii.) Agricultural products. â€” The valuation of the principal classes of agri- 
cultural crops was taken from the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for 
the year 1912. The valuation of other agricultural crops was taken from the Census 
report of 1909, with an allowance for the increase from 1909 to 1912. The value of 
agricultural products in the possession of farmers and traders at the 31st December, 
1912, was estimated to be 90% of the value of the crops of that year. 

(xix.) Manufactured products. â€” The value of manufactures in 1912 was esti- 
mated by adding to the valuc< in 1909 an increase based on that experienced between 
1904 and 1909. The value of exports of principal domestic manufactin-es was de- 
ducted to obtain value for domestic use. It was then assumed that one-twelfth 
of the value of foodstuffs and one-half of the value of other products for domestic 
use were in the possession of merchants, and that the value of materials and products 
in the hands of factories was one-sixth of the gross products for 1912. 

(XX.) Imported merchandise. â€” The value of imported merchandise in bonded 
warehouses and in the hands of traders was assiuned to be one- half of the value of 
all such goods imported during 1912 into the United States, exclusive of Alaska, 
Hawaii, and Porto Rico. 

(xxi. ) Mining Products. â€” The value of the mineral production for 1 9 1 2 was taken 
from the report of the Geological Survey. The value of pig-iron and other derived 
products was eliminated, being already included with manufactures. It was as- 
sumed that the whole of the coal produced in 1912 and one-tenth of the other mineral 
products were on hand at 31st December, 1912, the balance of the other mineral 
products being accounted for in the hands of the manufacturers, etc. 

(xxii.) Clothing and articles of personal adornment. â€” The value taken for articles 
of a perishable nature, such as clothing, furnishings, dress goods, cosmetics, perfumes, 
etc., was that of such articles manufactured and imported during 1912. The value 
taken for articles of a more or less permanent value, such as jewellery of all kinds 



Estimates of National Wkalth of United States of America. 167 

watches, etc., was obtained by adding the value of the articles of this class manu- 
factured and imported from 1902 to 1912 inclusive to the value of such articles as 
were held in 1902, less one-half for loss and destruction. 

(xxiii.) Furniture, carriages and kindred property. â€” For articles in this group 
which were considered as perishable, such as kitchen utensils, fancy goods, trunks, 
valises, etc., only the product of 1912 was used. For those articles which might 
reasonably be expected to retain a considerable portion of their original value, such as 
household fvirniture, automobiles, musical instruments, carriages, sewing machines, 
etc., the value of the products for the years 1904 to 1912 inclusive, and the net im- 
ports for the same period, were added to 20% of the value of the products of this 
class on hand in 1904. A deduction was made on account of loss and deprecia- 
tion, while to account for stock in trade already included under other heads a deduc- 
tion of 50% of the total manufactures and imports for 1912 was made. 

(xxiv.) Aggregate for 1912. â€” The total estimated for the year 1912 was 
$187,739,071,090 (=Â£38,577,000,000 at $4.86f to the Â£). The sterling values of 
detailed items for 1912 will be found in section 10 hereunder, in conjunction with 
corresponding values for 1900 and 1904. 

10. Details for 1900, 1904 and 1912. â€” For convenience of comparison the detailed 
figures for 1900, 1904, and 1912 are given in the attached table, the values being 
expressed in millions of Â£'s sterling. The conversion was made on the basis of 
$4,861 to the Â£.

PART Vn. -MISCELLANEOUS ESTIMATES OF WEALTH. 

CHAPTER I.â€” ESTIMATES OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM. 



1. General. â€” In the case of the United Kingdom there has, up to the present, 
been no official estimate of the wealth of the Kingdom as a whole or of any of its 
component parts. Numerous estimates of varying degrees of reliability have, how- 
ever, been made by various investigators, the bases of such estimates being also very 
varied. Much of the material given hereunder concernmg the early estimates of 
wealth has been obtained from Giffen's "â–  Growth of Capital," published in 1889. 



2. Sir William Petty's estimate (about 1679). â€” One of the earliest of these 
estimates was that made by Sir William Petty, the fomider of the so-called " Political 
Arithmetic." In this estimate, as originally prepared, an item was included for a 
capital valuation of the income from personal services, but in Giffen's review the 
amount is omitted as not being on all fours with the other items in the estimate, and 
not being comparable with subsequent estimates based upon Income Tax Returns. 
With the exclusion of the item mentioned, Petty's estimate was as follows : â€”

Giffen estimates that the population of England at the time when Petty wrote, 
was about 5,500,000. On this basis the capital of the coimtry would average about 
Â£46 per head. 



3. Gregory King's estimate (1688).- â€” The next estimate of importance is that 
which was prej^ared by Mr. Gregory King in respect of the year 1688. These figures 
were discussed very fully by Sir William Davcnant, and were adopted by him with 
the express acknowledgment that they were due to Mr. Gregory King. An estimate 
<o{ the capitalised value of personal service was made in this case as in that of Petty,

but it has been omitted from the table given below, since it is, in essence, an estimate 
of the value of the human beings constituting the population, not an estimate of 
their reahsed wealth. With this omission King's estimate is as follows : â€”

33,000,000 



25,000,000 



Total. 



320,000,000 



Giffen estimates the population at this date at aViout 5,500,000, thus giving an 
average wealth of Â£58 per head. 

In reference to the foregoing estimates of Petty and King, it may be noted that 
Petty deduced his values of houses by capitalising house rents at 12 years' " piu"- 
chase," while he used 18 years' " purchase" in the case of land values. In King's 
estimate 18 years' '" purchase" was used in both instances. 

Giffen states that a review of the estimates of Petty and King, and of the data 
on which they were based, leads to the conclusion that though some increase must 
have taken place between the two dates (1679 and 1688), it was probably not as great 
as the estimates suggest, and that on the whole King's figures appear to be the more 
reliable of the two estimates. 



4. Estimate based on Deckers figures (1740)^ â€” In an essay by Sir Matthew 
Decker on the "â€¢ Causes of the decline of foreigix trade," particulars are given in re- 
spect of the income of the people of England, on the basis of which Giffen, applying 
the methods of Petty and King, deduces an aggregate of Â£480,000,000 as an estimate 
of the wealth of the people of England in 1740. For a populat ion of about 7,000,000, 
this gives an average of about Â£69 ])er head. 



5. Beeke's estimate of wealth of Great Britain (1800). â€” In a work entitled 
" Observations on the produce of the income-tax, etc.," the Kev. H. Broke furnished 
in 1800 an estimate of the capital of Great Britain. It will be noted that the esti- 
mates previously quoted relate to England alone. 

The major portion of this estimate is based upon a ca])italisation of the income 
from various sources. In the following table are given Beeke's figures as modified 
by Giffen, deductions having been made by him concerning an item of Â£300.000,000 
included by Beeke in respect of the national debt, as well as an item of Â£250,000,000 
'â€¢ for the capitalisation of the income of the nation applied to Government expendi- 
ture and debt interest." Giffen states that he also made various corrections in the 
table after carefully perusing the text. The result is as follows : â€”

For a population of say 11,000,000, this works out at an average of about Â£158 
per head. 

Giffen suggests that furniture, plate, etc., and specie, which together 
aggregate Â£250,000,000, appear to have been valued too highly when compared 
with houses for which the value of Â£200,000,000 is given. In all other respects 
he considers Beeke's estimates as moderate, and says that he can see no reason 
why they should not be made use of as good contemporary estimates, and that Beeke's 
work is all extremely good. 



6. Colquhoun's estimate (1812) and others based thereon. â€” Estimates for the 
United Kingdom relative to the early part of the nineteenth century were made for 
the years 1812, 1822 and 1833, on the basis of figures compiled by a Mr. Colquhoim, 
who appears to have been an officer of the Board of Trade. Colquhoim's estimate 
for the value of property in the United Kingdom in 1812 was Â£2,736,000,000, giving, 
with a population of about 17,000,000, an average of about Â£161 per head. Giffen,. 
after reviewing Colquhoun's data and calculations, expresses the opinion that the 
estimate is a fairly good one. 

An estimate for the United Kingdom, based on Colquhoun's, was made by Mr. 
Joseph Lowe in respect of the year 1822. This estimate totalled Â£2,200.000,000, or, 
including items of unproductive private property, such as furniture, plate, etc., 
which were included by Colquhoun, but omitted by Lowe, an aggregate of say 
Â£2,500,000,000. On a population of about 21,000,000, this gives an average of about 
Â£119 per head. It is believed that the decline between the 1812 and the 1822 esti- 
mates was due in large measure to the inflation of prices existing in 1812, which was 
three years prior to the termination of the Napoleonic wars. 

Another estimate for the United Kingdom, based on Colquhoun's, was given in 
respect of the year 1833 by M. Pablo de Pebrer. This estimate totalled 
Â£3,690,000,000, or Â£148 per head on the basis of a population of 25,000,000. Giffen 
indicates certain defects in the estimate, but thinks that it " may, perhaps, pass as a 
contemporary valuation for the period between 1830 and 1840." He also points 
put that the first returns for the renewed income tax for 1843 exhibit such an increase 
as on the whole to confirm M. Pablo de Pebrer for 1833.

7. Giffen's estimates for 1865 and 1875. â€” In a paper read before the Royal 
Statistical Society ^ in 1878, Sir Robert Gift'en furnished estimates of the wealth of 
the United Kingdom for the years 1865 and 1875. In referring in the course of his 
paper to the determination of existing capital, Giffen says: " The most convenient 
basis for such a proceeding appears now to be the income tax assessments. The 
method is to discriminate as far as possible in these returns the different sources of 
income, capitalise these at a suitable niunber of years' purchase, and then make an 
allowance or conjecture for the capital of the income not liable to income tax, or 
which otherwise escapes assessment, and for capital which is not treated in the 
income tax returns as income yielding." 

As the method employed is one of some importance, it has been deemed advis- 
able to give in full Giffen's table exhibiting his data, and the calculations employed 
in computing the estimated capital value.

Miscellaneous Estimates of Wealth. 



The income assessed for taxation which was not brought to account for capital- 
isation in this estimate comprised (i.) fovir-fifths of income from trades and profes- 
sions (luider Schedule D), Â£140,000,000, (ii.) the permanent charge on the national 
debt for 1875-6, viz., Â£21,737,000, and (iii.) Schedule E, made \ip of salaries, pensions 
and annuities not earned by capital, totalling Â£32,540,000. These three items of 
income totalled Â£194,277,000. 

The total wealth shewn above, viz., Â£8,548,120,000, represents about Â£259 per 
head of the population of some 33,000,000. 

It may be noted that this method of estimating is, in essence, a variant of the 
inventory method, the vahies of the various assets bemg in the main based upon a 
capitalisation of the income which they realise. 

In the samie paper Giffen makes an estimate for the United Kingdom on similar 
lines for 1865, and obtains a total of Â£6,114,063,000, or Â£204 per head of the then 
population of 30,000,000. 



' 8. Giffen's estimate Jor 1885.- â€” In his work on "The Growth of Capital,"* 
Giffen gives an estimate for the United Kingdom for 1885, based upon data and cal- 
culations of the same natvire as those indicated in the preceding section as having 
been used for the 1865 and 1875 estimates. The total obtained for 1885 was 
Â£10,037,436,000, or Â£279 per head of the then popxilation of 36,000,000. In the 
preparation of the 1885 estimate some minor alterations were made in the number of 
years' purchase adopted for the capitalisation of incomes. In some cases the number 
was increased, and in others diminished, the aggregate for 1885 being affected less 
than a half of one per cent, by the change. 



9. Giffen's Estimate for 1903. â€” A further estimate was made by Sir Robert 
Giffen for a paper contributed by him to the Economics and Statistics Section of the 
British Association in September, 1903. * This estimate, however, which was not 
the main object of the paper, was not prepared with the same analysis of detail as 
characterised his estimates for 1865, 1875, and 1885, and caimot be regarded as more 
than a very rough approximation made to furnish a convenient working basis for the 
consideration of modes of expenditure. In addition to an estimate for the United 
Kingdom the paper contains similar estimates in respect of Canada, Australasia^ 
India, South Africa, and the remainder of the Empire. 

The figure so given for the wealth of the United Kingdom is Â£15,000,000,000, 
or Â£355 per head of the population, which in 1903 was about 42,250,000. The 
figures given in the paper for the British Empire are as follows : â€”

These figures have been somewhat extensively quoted, e.f/., by Augustus D. 
"\Vebb, F.S.S., in " The New Dictionary of Statistics" for 1911, and by the Bureau 
of the Census, Washington, but it is clear from the context of the paper in which 
they appear that they were not put forward by the author as representing in most 
cases anything more than what may be termed " well-informed guesses." 

10. Harris and Lakes estimate, 1903-6. â€” In a paper read before the Royal 
Statistical Society^ on 18th December, 1906, Messrs. Harris and Lake discxissed the 
compilation of wealth estimates on the basis of probate returns (see Part V. hereof). 
As the result of the calculations so made supplemented by estimates in respect of 
property not subject to death dvities, the total wealth of the United Kingdom at or 
about the end of 1904 was estimated at Â£9,207,000,000, thus falling short of Giffen's 
rough estimate, quoted in Section 9, by nearly Â£6,000,000,000. In view of the 
analysis of the limitations of the probate method given in Part V. hereof, there is 
little doubt that the estimate of Messrs. Harris and Lake is very much in defect. 

11. Mallet's estimate, 1905 and 1906. â€” In a paper read before the Royal Statis- 
tical Society, 2 on 18th February, 1908, Mr. (now Sir) Bernard Mallet further 
discxissed the question of estimates based on probate returns, and in the course of 
his paper gave an estimate for England and Wales of Â£5,500,000,000, on the basis 
of the 1905 returns, and Â£6,098,000,000, on the basis of the 1906 returns, 
irrespective of any allowance on account of property not subject to death duties. 
For the reasons already referred to, it is probable that these estimates are much 
below the truth (see Part V. hereof). 

12. Cbiozza Money's estimate, 1908.^ â€” In an estimate based largely on the 
method of capitalising incomes, Mr. L. (4. Chiozza Money* gave as a total for the 
Wealth of the United Kingdom m 1908 a sum of Â£13,762,000,000, or Â£313 per head 
on a population of some 44,000,000. 



CHAPTER n.â€” ESTIMATES OF WEALTH IN FRANCE. 

1. Various early estimates. â€” On p. 127 of his work, already mentioned (" The 
Growth of Capital"), (riffen quotes M. de Foville as having fiirnished in his " La 
France Economique " particulars cf several estimates of the value of property in 
France, and gives the following summary of some of the more important of these : â€”

3. Edmond Thery's estimate, 1908.- â€” ^In Dr. Karl Helfferich's " Germany's 
economic progress and national wealth," M. Edmond Thery is quoted as having 
furnished for France for 1908 an estimate of wealth amounting to about 
Â£11,400,000,000. 



CHAPTER III.â€” ESTIMATES OF WEALTH IN GERMANY. 

1. Bucher's estimate, 1908. â€” ^In " The New Dictionary of Statistics" for 1911, 
Augustus D. Webb quotes Biicher as giving an estimate of the wealth of Germany 
for 1908 totalling alx)ut Â£16,000,000,000. 



2. Helfferich's estimate, 1910-11. â€” In his " Germany's economic progress and 
national wealth," Dr. Karl Helfferich gives for the year 1910-11 an estimate of the 
wealth of Germany as lying between Â£14,000,000,000 and Â£15,600,000,000. 



3. Estimate of wealth in Prussia, 1911. â€” Returns shewing the wealth of Prussia 
were published in the " Statistisches Jahrbuch fiir den Preussischen Staat" for 1913, 
issued in 1914. The assessment presumably a])plies to the year 1911. The total 
population was about 40,739,600 in 1914 ; or about 40,165,219 at the end of the year 
1911. Taking the " mark" asof the value one shilling, the res\ilt was Â£5,195,926,400 
for all persons possessing wealth of the value Â£300 (viz., 1,767,034), and not excepted 
by special provisions of the law : or including the latter (2,009,170 persons), the 
result was Â£5,353,291,550. There are, however, over 38 million persons not 
accounted for. In obtaining the totals, the methods of ascertaining the amoimts 
(followed by the Prussian authorities) were as follows : â€”

176 



In all cases where the wealth was less than Â£50,000 (1,000,000 marks), the total 
was obtained by multiplying the number of cases by the middle value of the range ; 
in all cases where the individual wealth was greater than Â£50,000 the true totals were 
given.

persons possessed of under Â£300, the ranges Â£300-. 500, Â£500-Â£750, Â£750-Â£l,000 being .50, .32, and .18 of 
the total Â£300-Â£l,000, while the Prussian returns gave .46, .28, and .26. The number in Australia 
possessed of under Â£300, including children, etc., was 20.7 times the number possessed of Â£300-Â£l,000, 
while in Prussia it was 63.3 times that number. It is inferred that the average can hardly be more 
than Â£10 per head. 



This represents Â£142 15s. 8d. per head of population.

1. Limitations â€” It cannot be too strongly emphasised that by whatsoever 
means an estimate of the wealth of a community is compiled, the resultant figures 
can never be regarded as more than rough approximations. Normally the wealth 
of an individual at any given moment may, from certain points of view, be said to 
be represented by the market value of the property of various kinds of which he is 
then in possession, the tacit assvimption made being that a market exists for each 
class of property. Although such a basis of valuation might be said to be inapplic- 
able to the wealth of the whole community, because of the impossibility of treating 
it as all subject to sale at the same moment, it may nevertheless be supposed that the 
individual items of wealth might be sold under conditions conforming to the general 
state of the community. In this case the aggregate of the values can be taken to be 
the aggregate wealth expressed in terms of money. 

Apart from this assumption of a hypothetic possibility of sale, it is often not 
practicable to determine a reliable value for certain of the private possessions, even 
though these contribute largely to the well-being of the community. In most of 
such cases the cost would be too high to take for the purposes of a valuation, while the 
price likely to be realised at a forced sale would usually represent far less than the 
value of the possessions to the owner in the absence of such a sale. These and similar 
limitations apply to all valuations available for the purpose of wealth-estimates, 
whether such valuations are made in respect of probate returns, for war census 
purposes, or for the purposes of an inventory estimate. A review of the conclusions 
relative to these several methods of estimation is given in succeeding chapters. 

In addition to the limitations which result from valuation difficulties, there are 
others that arise, in the case of comparative returns, from differences in the methods 
and minutiae of estimation adopted at the several dates in respect of the estimates 
constituting the subject of comparison. Thus, the comparison of an estimate based 
on probate returns for a given period with an inventory estimate for a date not 
included in that period might siiggest an increase or decrease in the wealth of the 
community, though this might be largely fictitious, owing to failure to take into 
account the characteristic peculiarities of the several estimates. For this reason, it is 
essential that an estimate for which any degree of reliability is claimed should be 
accompanied by an explicit account of the method adopted, and, where practicable, 
a detailed review of the contributing items. Without this the significance of the 
estimate for comparative purposes is not sxifficiently definite. 

Another limitation to such estimates is that due to the personal equation of the 
observer. This is, of course, true of all observations, but is especially in evidence in 
the present case, where the judgments of different observers enter so largely into the 
question. For example, in a determination of the values of real estate in the Com- 
monwealth by the inventory method, an aggregation is made for Australia of the 
values allocated to different properties by the municipal valuers of some 1070 
different local governing bodies. Similar considerations apply to individual 
estimates in the case of a wealth census or of a return for probate purposes, and are 
also applicable to the exercise of judgment on the part of the statistician responsible 
for the estimate. 



Census of WEAiiXH and Income. 177 

2. Uses. â€” In his work " The growth of capital," previously quoted, Giffen 
indicates nvunerous uses to which estimates of wealth may be put, of which the fol- 
lowing is a summary : â€” 

(i.) To measure the accumulation of capital in communities at intervals of some 
length (not less perhaps than ten years). 

(ii.) To compare the income of a community, where estimates of income exist, 
with its property. 

(iii.) To measure the burden of national debts upon different communities. 

(iv.) To measure, in conjunction with other factors such as aggregate income, 
revenue and population, the relative strength and resources of different communities. 

(v.) To indicate generally the proportions of the different descriptions of pro- 
perty in a country to the total â€” how the wealth of a community is composed. 

(vi.) To measure the progress of a community from period to period, or the 
relative progress of two or more communities, in conjunction with facts as to pro- 
gress in income, revenue, population, etc. 

(vii.) To compare the aggregate accumulation in a community with that portion 
of the accumulation which can be described as free savings, which latter is gradually 
invested through the agency of the Stock Exchange. 

(viii.) To throw light on the question of changes in the value of money (which 
changes are themselves among the facts to be investigated and allowed for in com- 
paring the valuations of different countries or the valuations of the same country at 
different times). 

To the uses above specified may be added the following, which are available in 
respect of a wealth and income census, and to some extent in respect of an estimate 
based on probate retvirns : â€” 

(ix.) To determine the distribution of wealth amongst the indivndual members 
of the community, and thus to furnish a measiu-e of the relative degree of opulence 
or penury of the various classes and the number of persons in each of such classes. 

(x.) To enable a comparison of wealth with income to be made in respect of the 
various classes. 

It is clear that in order to be applicable to the purposes indicated above, the 
estimate, however made, must represent a fairly close approximation to the actual 
facts, but in view of what has already been said in sec. 1 of the present Chapter, it is 
evident that close accuracy is unattainable, and in some respects may even be said 
not to be suscei^tible of exact definition. 



CHAPTER n.â€” CENSUS OF WEALTH AND INCOME. 

1. General. â€” From the nature of the case, it might be assumed that the most 
complete and accurate record of the wealth of the community would be obtained by 
asking the information of the individual owners themselves, in other words, by taking 
a wealth census, and in some respects this assumption is often warranted. It is 
however, subject to various limitations and conditions, which will be considered in the 
succeeding sections. 



178 Conclusions. 

2. War Census of 1915. â€” As previously stated, a census of wealth was taken in 
1915 in connection withthe census of males of military age, but owing to its emerg- 
ency character, and the fact that the returns were not distributed or collected as in 
the case of a census of population, there were serious defects in the numbers of per- 
sons furnishing returns, and less serious though probably important shortages in the 
total amount as compiled from the returns. The total amount recorded was approxi- 
mately Â£1,643,000,000, but from the nature of the case there are evidently no means 
of determining even approximately the amount of wealth omitted by default in the 
supply of returns. The machinery of the War Census Act threw upon the members 
of the commmiity the responsibility for the supply of the information, the requisite 
forms, envelopes, etc., being made available at all post offices. With such a method, 
and in the absence of a record of the people liable to make returns, it is clear that the 
detection of default except in certain accidental cases becomes almost an impossi- 
bility. 

3. Advantages and disadvantages of census method. â€” A marked feature of the 
wealth census method of obtaining the desired information is the fact that particulars 
can be obtained by it of the number and amount of estates of any given size, and 
further, that by including provision for a record of income on the census form, valuable 
information concerning the relation of wealth to income under various circumstances 
can be satisfactorily obtained with a minimum of labour. 

A further advantage of the method is the fact that the information being fur- 
nished in each case by the owner, the labour of valuation is widely distributed, and is 
made by the person who, in the majority of cases, is moat intimately in touch with the 
requisite data. Associated with this advantage, however, is the disadvantage that 
in certain cases the fear of subsequent taxation conduces to undervaluation. 

The principal disadvantage of the method is the cost which such a census neces- 
sarily entails owing to the large volume of detailed particulars which is presented for 
tabulation and compilation. Another disadvantage is the necessity which exists 
for the observation of the strictest secrecy in respect of the returns furnished. The 
extreme sensitiveness of many members of the community in this respect is such as 
probably to render inapplicable the method of collection adopted at an ordinary 
population census. Special machinery for the collection of the data would thus be 
necessitated, thereby increasing the expense and delaying the publication of the 
results. 



4. Suggestions for future action. â€” In view of the fact that the wealth and income 
census gives important results in respect of the community which are not obtainable 
by any other method of estimation, it appears desirable that such a census should be 
taken every ten years in conjunction ivith the ordinary population census now provided 
for under the " Census and Statistics Act 1905." By such means the cost referred 
to above would be considerably rediiced, as the wealth and income census forms could 
V)e distributed by the census collectors, and if no objection were offered by the person 
making the return, the collector could also collect the form with the ordinary popula- 
tion returns. In those cases in which there is an objection to disclosing the par- 
ticulars in respect of wealth and income to a local resident (the collector) even though 
under an oath of secrecy, arrangements could be made for the collector to furnish an 
envelope for the transmission of the form post free to the Commonwealth Statistician, 
and could, Vjy a note to this effect in his record book, ensure that the person to whom 
the envelope was issued would not be overlooked in the event of default. 



Succession Method of Estimating Private Wealth. 179 



CHAPTER III â€”SUCCESSION METHOD OF ESTIMATING PRIVATE WEALTH. 

1. Succession methods. â€” -Estimates of private wealth based upon any form of the 
succession method really depend upon a correct determination of the proportion of 
the aggregate of wealth which passes in a unit of time (1 year). The limitations of 
the method have already been indicated in Part V., see in particular see. 39., p. 131, 
where conclusions regarding the probate method are set out. In any attempt to 
accurately ascertain the proportion of all wealth which passes in a year, it has ti. be 
remembered that the proportion in question depends upon the sex and for successions 
proper {i.e., by death, as in probate cases), upon the death-rates according to sex. 
Obviously, also, it depends upon the amount passing by "settlements" (i.e., by 
gifts at marriage, or otherwise). Estimates of aggregate wealth are in defect when- 
ever wealth passes without record, and the circumstances of settlement must be 
accurately known as regards the ages both of the donors and donees, for only in this 
way can the proportion passing in a unit of time be known. A little consideration 
will shew that so far as marriage settlenAits are concerned the rate of " passing" 
is appreciably greater than the passing of wealth by the death of its possessor. 

To ascertain the proportion of wealth passing by death, it is strictly necessary 
to know the death-rate according to the wealth possessed, if the average death-rate 
vary with the wealth possessed. Hence, inquiry into this question is essential if 
high precision be aimed at. 

Estimates of wealth for probate are likely to be always in defect, consequently 
their correction should be attempted. The factor of correction may, however, itself 
â– change with time ; that has to be ascertained. 

At the present time there is no adequate statistic which could form a perfectly 
satisfactory basis for succession estimates, but there is no reason why in any 
-civically disciplined community such statistic should not be available. 



2. Statistical requirements for an accurate succession method. â€” The statistical 
requirements for the accurate ascertainment of the 7-ote of succession, i.e., the pro- 
portion of wealth passing in a unit of time (1 year, say) â€” is therefore : â€” 

(i.) Recordof deaths according to age, sex, wealth possessed. 

(ii.) Record of the numbers living in the same categories. 

(iii.) Record of the ages of donors of wealth, and of the donees also, together 
with the amoimts donated : 

(a) in the case of settlements at marriage, and 
(6) in the case of other settlements, 
(iv.) Variations in numbers of deaths, marriages, etc. 

It has to be borne in mind that all attempts to ascertain the ratio of the living 
to the dying, for any sex, age, and class, from mortality tables, is liable to consider- 
able error, and also that in limited populations the experience of a single year will 
not give sufficiently large numbers to furnish re])resentative or average results. 
The succession method then must always be deemed one of inferior accuracy. 

The essential limitation of the succession methods is that it must necessarily be 
assumed that the proportion of the aggregate of private wealtii jnvssing in a unit of 
time will be constant if the death-rate and general conditions of the conaminiity are 



180 Conclusions. 

constant. This assumption is doxibtless on the \vhole valid, but reveals the intrinsic 
nature of the estimate, viz., that it is one which does not apply to any given moment 
of time, but gives â€” presumably^ â€” a result which is an average over the period from 
which the data are drawn. 

In regard to the absolute value of the estimate, it may be also noted that, inas- 
much as the ratio of the living to the dying is a large one, and varies from age to age, 
the errors or any peculiarities in the data are correspondingly magnified in the result. 



CHAPTER IV.â€” THE INVENTORY METHOD OF ESTIMATION. 

1. General. â€” Of all estimates of wealth, the method which involves the smallest 
expenditure of public funds is that usually known as the inventory method. This 
apparent saving, however, is not due t@ paucity of data, but to the fact that the 
estimates so made are based very largely on statistical data which have been obtained 
for other purposes, and which require relatively little work to reduce them to the form 
requisite for the purposes of the valuation. In ultimate analysis the sources of 
information are both numerous and varied, as is evident from a review of the 
details given in Part VI., Chapter I. hereof. 

2. Advantages and disadvantages of the inventory method. â€” As just mentioned, 
one of the advantages of the method is cheapness, owing to utilisation of existing 
data. This feature leads to the further advantage that the estimates may be made 
at much shorter intervals than in the case when relatively expensive methods are 
employed. 

A fiirther advantage is that, from the nature of the method the data are available 
in groups according to the nature of the wealth, but this is accompanied by the dis- 
advantage that the method does not furnish means for the classification of wealth 
according to the size of the estates involved, and does not furnish any facilities for a 
detailed comparison of assets and income. The limitations of this method arising 
from the difficulty of assigning an appropriate value to certain classes of possessions 
are common to all valuations. For example, in the case of such items as furniture, 
clothing, household and personal effects, etc., it is probable that an estimate based on 
a consideration of the population and the number of dwellings of different sizes and 
rentals is at least as sound as the estimates imder such heads furnished at a wealth 
census or in probate returns. 

3. Suggestions for future action. â€” Owing to the small cost involved, it appears 
desirable that an estimate of wealth on the inventory basis should be maxie every 
five years, or with shorter intervals. The more frequent estimates would naturally 
lead to improvement in the basis adopted imder the various heads, and would thus 
tend to increase the reliability of the estimates. Owing to its essential limitations, 
however, it appears desirable that an inventory estimate made say, quinqueiuiially, 
should be siipplemented by a decennial censiis of wealth. By such means extensive 
information of a valuable character would bo available in respect of the material 
progress of the community. It would also be advisable in the preparation of sub- 
sequent estimates of this character to supplement the particulars concerning private 
wealth by obtaining estimates in respect of such national and communal wealth as is 
capable of valuation.
