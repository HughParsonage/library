                                 PREFACE.


      As indicated by the      title,   the matter contained herein relates
mainly to the private wealth of Australia, and an examination                      of
the various methods adopted here and elsewhere for the purpose of
estimating the wealth of a community.               It includes also a brief
report of the results of the        War   Census in respect of        {a)   males of
military age,    (6)   net private income of the people,        (c)    net private
assets of the people.        Many   of these latter   have already appeared
from time to time      in the publications of the     Bureau.


      The three            methods of estimating the wealth of a
                   principal
community,            by means of a wealth-census, (ii.) by the use
                viz., (i.)

of probate-returns, (iii.) by the inventory -method based on mis-
cellaneous statistical and other records, are considered in some
detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed.



      An   estimate of the private wealth of Australia based on pro-
bate returns was        made   in 1911     by Mr. A. M. Laughton,             F.I. A.,

P.F.A., the    Government      Statist   of Victoria, who obtained a         total of

£990,000,000, which he subsequently increased to £l,0&i,000,000.
Reasons are given herein for the opinion that owing                        to defects

inherent in the probate-return methods, this estimate                 is   below the
truth,   and   this opinion is   supported by the      War      Census records,
which, although clearly incomplete, gave for the private wealth of
Australia in 191.5 a total of £1,643,000,000.           A further      evidence of
the defect in the method based upon probate-returns              is    an estimate
for 1915 contained hereui based       upon the inventory -method. This
estimate gave a total for      Australia of £1,620,000,000. For the sake
of   comparison an allowance should be made for items which are
excluded from private wealth in the inventory -method,                       but are
included therein at a wealth-census and in probate-returns.                    These
are such assets as the locally held securities in respect of public
and municipal debt. With this allowance the comparable inventory
total becomes about £1,760,000,000 as at the 30th June, 1915, or
                                   Preface.


say £355 per head of population.           This total   is   an estimate   of all

the private material wealth existing in Australia at 30th June,
1915, whether owned by Australian residents or not, with the
addition of a sum of £140,000,000 estimated as the value of locally
held securities in respect of loans to Australian Governments and
local governing bodies.    The portion of the Australian total be-
longing to persons not resident in Australia          is difficult   to estimate
but is probably in the neighbourhood of £175,000,000.

       As a   result of the careful review of the several estimates, the
conclusion arrived at    is   that the most satisfactory wealth estimates
will   be obtained by means of a combination of the wealth census and
inventory methods.

                  PART     I   —THE NATURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH.
                                   CHAPTER I.—INTRODUCTION.
        1.    General.   —^The    aggregate Private Wealth of any homogeneous community
constituting a nation, together            with its corporate possessions, may be called its
 National Wealth.    A clear understanding of the essential character of such wealth
is important, since confusion of thought is common in regard thereto. For this
reason it is necessary to pay attention both to the nature of its component elements
and the means          of estimating their value, as well as to the uncertainties   and limitations
of     such       estimates.

      In regard to ownership, the wealth of any country may mean several things,
viz., either  (i.) the wealth owned by the people domiiciled therein (a) the corpus
itself being within the country, or (6) without that restriction or (ii.) the wealth
                                                                           ;


within the country irrespective of the domicile of the owner. Owing to what has
                                                                 —
been called the " anonymity" of capital, wealth may ^to a considerable extent
be owned by persona not only not domiciled in a country, but even by those who
owe    it    no    allegiance.

     In respect of value an estimate of national wealth may be founded upon more or
lessshrewd guesses at the average wealth per unit of population upon rough com-;


putations based upon statistics of banking deposits, together with houses and land
occupied    and similar data. Such guesses, however, have no authority, since their
              ;


degree of accurracy cannot be ascertained. A census of the wealth of a group in
any community, either taken at random, or better, properly selected, gives a result
of greater weight.    Estimates may also be founded upon returns of income                     —
method which, however, is very precarious upon the value of estates of deceased
                                                      ;


persons, considered as representative of the rest of the community.      This latter
method would appear to have claim to considerable confidence. With proper
precautions, doubtless any or all of these methods may well be employed.

     Estimations based on the values of the estates of persons dying have been sup-
posed by many to be of peculiar value, inasmuch as the responsible evaluation of
estates for the purposes of probate presumably furnishes results of more than ordin-
ary accuracy. In fact, the estates of deceased persons are assmned to be, as it were,
a most appropriate parcel, viz., one taken quite at random, and sufficiently large to
be representative. The method of estimating the total wealth from probate returns
will consequently be exhaustively considered.     The best result is, of course, fur-_
nished by a complete census of wealth, provided that the valuations are carefully
made upon a common               basis.
2                                           The Nattirb of National Wealth.

         2.     Value,      how       estimated          :    its   uncertainty.   —The term " Wealth" has, of course,
no unique meaning, nor      the value of anything which may be classed as wealth
                                                 is

always susceptible of exact expression in terms of money. This applies more
particularly to the corporate possessions of a people. Though the values in which
estimates of wealth are expressed must necessarily be exchange-values, these are by
no means fixed and unalterable, nor are they, though necessarily the common basis
of all comparisons, readily ascertained with a high degree of accuracy.

         Wealth-     —in           we are considering is ordinarily represented by
                                the sense which                                             —
tangible securities,     currency, consols, inscribed stocks, bonds, shares, real-
                                      e.g.,

estate, etc. The values of these, however, often rapidly fluctuate with public credit
or popular appreciation.  For this reason estimates of value need to be made as                                                  —
far as possible           —     in   normal times, and changes                     of value     do not necessarily represent
actual changes in the physical element constituting the wealth.   When the purpose
isto ascertain the material basis of wealth the method will of course differ (e.g., the
numbers, rather than the values of flocks and herds would then be important).



     3.   Impoitance oJ clear statements as to methods o£ estimation. It has already                             —
been said that mere quesses are without real value, at least for comparative pur-
poses, and it is evident from what has preceded, that the proper estimation of the
total wealth of any community is not a simple matter.        Some so-called estimates
are little better than examples of " statistical charlatanism."

     Statistical estimates, in order to possess authority, must be well founded,
and consequently the basis upon which they rest must be declared. When they are
given on personal authority only, their value cannot be ascertained. For this reason
statisticians and other pubhoists recognise that mere personal opinion, or a mere
statistical ipse dixit, must not be allowed weight, not only because it lends itself to
statistical imposition, but also because the reliableness of the results put forward
cannot be indicated.

     In his " Sozialstatistik" (Leipzig, 1908), G. Schnapper-Amdt says      concerning                               :   —
certain tables   purporting to give the national wealth of a number of civilised
countries       —
            that the greater part of the particulars have been merely fabricated. ^
Very little consideration will shew the force of this remark. For, quite apart from
the basic difficulty of accurately estimating in terms of money various forms of
wealth, very few people can say off-hand, with any exactitude, the value of what they
possess.   Moreover, values themselves have a wide range, viz., from those disclosed
under conditions of " forced sale" to those when sales are under the most favourable
conditions for the seller. Hence even when a comprehensive census of wealth is under-
taken, and all persons are required to furnish, under appropriate categories, the value
of all material wealth possessed by them, with every safeguard to avoid repeated
inclusion of the            same items                (as     when encumbrances exist) the result is subject to a
larger        margin       of uncertainty                    than is commonly appreciated.     A comparison of
estimates of value                   made         at "       boom" times with those made at ordinary times is
but an extreme ease of this uncertainty. It is evident, from these and similar
considerations, that comparisons of wealth estimated as existing at different dates are
subject to a large measure ot imcertainty, quite apart from that arising from the
varying significance of the money standard, and deductions based on such estimates,
expressed in terms of pounds sterling, have to be used with corresponding caution.

    A careful consideration of the whole matter will disclose that among estimates of
wealth with any pretensions to accuracy there are two, at least, which take a high
place, viz.         :




             (1)   Estimates furnished in a Census of Wealth (usually                     made by its possessors);
             (2)   Estimates of wealth disclosed through death (probate returns).

The     first is        usually fairly complete, and    is of a precision governed by the integrity

of the returns themselves.                 Where the returns do not systematically either understate
or overstate, the final result               may be          regarded as of high precision.

     Although, as above stated, the second method is obviously of the nature of a
representative parcel,it is only a partial return, since probate returns are not required

for estates of smaE value, and therefore the total wealth will be understated if no
allowance be made for this fact. Moreover, for short periods the returns themselves
are subject to a considerable measure of uncertainty as " representative parcels,"
inasmuch as large estates come under review only with great irregularity. It will be
necessary to consider these limitations.



        4.       Sense in which wealth         is   attributaWe to individuals.          —A person         living in   any
community may                  possess wealth consisting of lands, goods, or instruments of credit,
 (a)   within the territory occupied            by that community,                or (6) without   it.    In the former
case there can be no doubt that such wealth                  part of the connnunal or national
                                                                           is

wealth       :    in the latter case, the purpose of the estimate would determine whether the
inclusion or exclusion of particular items                          was necessary. For ordinary purposes (6)
would be included                 in estimates of national wealth,              inasmuch as such wealth has
exchange-value, notwithstanding that the corpus itself is not in the territory occupied
by the community.                 There may, however,               in   some   cases be a measure of unceVtainty
as to the total wealth to be accredited to a coimtry, owing to uncertainties of nation-
ality    and domicile.             For example       :   —   ^Let   us suppose that A, an individual living in
the    community              considered, has property therein of value             W, subject to an encum-
brance of w, held over              it   by F, the   latter being abroad.             The value     to be recorded      is

 W—w     ;       and,    if   questions of domicile were always definite, and a census of wealth
was complete, there could be no imcertainty in respect of the estimation of the
communal wealth. If, however, F were only temporarily abroad, and his real
domicile were in the community, the total wealth ought to be W, the part "FT—«>
belonging to A, and the part w belong to F. ^



        5.   Wealth under private ownership.                   —^The term private wealth           is    used in contra-
distinction to public or semi-public wealth.                             In Australia the term would cover             all
that wealth, the proprietorship of which resides in individuals in their                                         private




      ^ The importance of questions of nationality and domicile have come into prominence through

recent events. Dual nationality, and the system by means of which all the responsibilities of nation-
ality can be avoided, and all its benefits seemed, are reflected in questions of ownership.     The estab-
lishment also of local companies almost wholly with foreign capital, the proportion of local capital
being merely nominal, may reduce the net value of large properties to a negligible quantity. Under
the present system foreigners can establish themselves in a territory (for example where an attack
on which is contemplated by their Governments), and thus, though the corpus of the wealtli may be
in the country, its legal possession and enjoyment may be foreign. This shews not only that the
difference between what may be called the geographical location of wealth and the domicile of its
ownership is of the first degree of Importance, but also that the wealth of a territory may be advantage-
ous or disadvantageous, according as its usufruct and potentialities are nationally enjoyed by the
country in question, or by a foreign people. See " Gliinsegnamenti della guerra circa il trattamento
degli stranieri, " by Prof. P. Fedozzi, " Scientia, I., xii., 1915, pp. 402-418," and " Nationality and
Naturalisation," by Dr. B. J. Schuster, Contemporary Eeview, Jan. 1917, pp. 93-99.

or   any form            of Local      Government. It thus comprises all wealth

            (ii.)      which       is   administered in trust or by delegation in the interest of

        (iv.)          which      is    collectively          owned by groups          of private persons   without any
                             specific allocation to individual proprietors.

       Section          (iv.)     comprises such forms of wealth as the property of Clubs, Chtirches,
Schools of Art, Mechanics Institutes, etc.                  These may for certain purposes be con-
veniently classed as social private wealth.



     6. Wealth under communal ownership.                                    —
                                               In all weU-developed modem com-
munities a considerable quantity of wealth is vested in local governing bodies of
various types, whose scope and functions are usually prescribed by legislation or by
regulations of the central government.     These bodies include city, municipal,
borough, shire and similar councils     irrigation-trusts tramway-trusts
                                                                 ;          school-        ;                   ;



boards     hospital-boards
            ;                fire-brigades    waterworks -boards
                                                ;                  harbour-trusts
                                                                       ;                           ;



etc., etc. The property held by them covers a wide field, and includes such items
as roads, railways, tramways, pubUc buildings, plant, machinery, reservoirs, water
channels,         etc., etc.            The    several bodies controlling these forms of wealth are required
to administer                them       in a public capacity for the benefit of the communitj"^ resident
within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the body in question. The property is in a
sense owned by the persons who make up that community, but it is owned by them
collectively not individually,                           and the constitution of the corporate controlling body
is   usually not amenable to direct alteration                          by the members of the community in
question.



     7.                                                               —
         Wealth under national owneiship. All those forms of wealth the proprietor-
ship of which vests in the central governing body may be conveniently classed as
being under national ovmership. In the case of AustraUa and other federations,
this is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is usually not one but two such
bodies (which divide the central control between them), viz., the Federal Government,

items of communal and national ownership.         For example, a building erected and
equipped aa a Parliament House or as a Public Library would be of little value, in
proportion to its cost, for any other purpose, and thus being practically unsaleable,
cannot be properly said to have any value in exchange. In other cases, as for example
Government Railways, there is no doubt that if offered for sale they would realise
high prices, but in the absence of any sales of this nature it is impossible for any
one to say what their exchange value might be, and how it would compare with
their cost of construction.   Another class of property under national ownership, viz.
Crown Lands, occupies a somewhat different position from either of the foregoing.
In closely settled districts there is practically always a market for real estate, and
within reasonable limits » fair exchange value could always be ascertained in
respect of the Crown Lands in such districts.      In sparsely settled pastoral districts
on the other hand, where the land is usually occupied under some form of lease from
the Crown, this does not apply, and it is even less applicable in the case of the
huge tracts of unoccupied lands which make up so large a proportion of the Crown
Lands of Australia.      Much of both of these latter classes will probably have
considerable exchange-value in the future, and possibly in the near future, but at
present there is no basis on which anything deserving the name of an estimate of
their value could be made.

     In the case of private wealth on the other hand there is not the same difficulty,
and in most cases reasonably accurate estimates of the exchange value can readily
be made. Thus we see that although both private and national wealth may be
productive in varying degrees, or may even involve varying degrees of loss, and that
these facts may materially affect the exchange value of the wealth, they are in
themselves irrelevant.             The exchange-value     is   the only relevant matter in estima-
tions of private wealth, other questions                may    therefore be dismissed from     con-
sideration, notwithstanding that for pa/rticular purposes other bases of estimation
may   be necessary, for example the value               of railway    and other public   services as
already indicated.



      9.   The fluctuation                      —
                                     ^It is important, however, to bear in mind that
                                   oJ wealth.
wealth     is   not a fixed,
                          always a fluctuating, quantity. In a country like Australia
                               it is

—                                                     —
   a large and compact island continent in which a considerable portion of the
wealth consists of flocks and herds, the fluctuations are quite considerable, not
merely because the physical elements of the wealth vary considerably with abund-
ance or dearth of rainfall, but also because their exchange-values are materially
affected by the same causes.   Drought conditions, for example, may not only cause
substantial losses in actual numbers, but also, because of the long distances to
markets, may prejudice their exchange-values.

     It is obvious, from considerations analogous to the above, that estimates of
wealth to be of the highest value and to serve for comparative purposes, must he
based upon average conditions. It follows, therefore, that a census of wealth which
merely gives values at a particular moment will, ordinarily, but imperfectly repre-
sent such average conditions.   On the other hand, however, it rarely happens in
extensive territories, that physical conditions are specially adverse or specially
favourable throughout the entire area at any given time        consequently, as the
                                                                           :



territory embraced in any estimate is increased in size, the result of any estimate
tends more and more to express average conditions.

     The range of fluctuation for different classes of wealth is by no means identical.
In the case of sheep and cattle in Axistralia, for example, the variations of exchange-
value are very large, while those for houses and buildings, plant and machinery, etc..

are, relatively thereto, only small.   In so-called " boom times," values ascribed to
land are unusually high     at the collapse of a " boom" they are very low

                                                                                national
                                                                                      :




securities fluctuate greatly with national credit, with the probability of war, or of the
fortunes of war, etc.     estimates for probate or other duties are usually too low,
                          ;


while estimates, made without regard to the liability to duty, are likely to be too high.

     In order that a Census of Wealth should fvunish a normal result, therefore, it is
requisite that the period covered should be sufficient to furnish average values. The
period over which the values are taken should consequently be commensurate with
the fluctuation periods, which, as said, are diverse for different classes of wealth.
A census of wealth representing values at a particular moment may be consequently
very unsatisfactory if the selected moment should happen to be one at which other
than average conditions obtain and this fact has to be kept in view.

          CHAPTER n.—VARIOUS MODES OF ESTIMATING WEALTH.

     1.                             —
         A census oJ wealth. A comprehensive census of wealth furnishes a direct
estimate of such part of the possessions of a community as can be expressed in terms
ofmoney values. Such » census indicates the wealth as referred to a particular
moment of time, and its worth depends upon the care with which the estimates of
exchange value are made.

     The nature     of the    War   Census, and of   its   merits and limitations are dealt with
in Parts II., III.,   and IV.

     2.                        —
           Piobate letuins. In practically all civilised countries there are what are
generally   known as " succession" duties, based upon the value of the estates which
pass to successors in      Owing to this a valuation has perforce to be made on the
                         title.

death of possessors.   Such valuations are available in Australia in the " probate
returns," and afford a means of gauging the wealth of the entire community, foras-
much as the returns shew the wealth possessed by a part of the community which
                   —                        —
can be regarded. as pointed out as a " fair sample."

     The methods which have been adopted for ascertaining the ratio between what
passes to successors in a unit of time (one year) and the total wealth of the cornmunitr.
are two, viz., (i.) the determination of the average interval of time between the passing
                                     and (ii.) the ascertainment of the average rate of
of estates to the successors in title,
the passing of estates during any period under review. The first may appropriately
be called the devolidion-interval method, and the second the devolution-rate nietliod.
                                     —                       —
Obviously the two methods are in the last analysis essentially the same, the number
of years in the devolution interval being the reciprocal of the annual rate of devolu-
tion.  At first sight it might therefore appear that it is a matter of little moment
which method we follow. This surmise is, however, not correct, for reasons which
are given hereinafter, and which, briefly expressed, are that the devolution-interval
method is the more complicated and imcertain, and that the corrections ^whioh
                                                                 —
must be applied to any crude estimate of its value are not readily computed or
easily    ascertained.


     3.   The devolution interval.— Since the average length of life differs in the case
ofmales and females, the devolution interval varies according to sex moreover    :
                                                                                       aa
the rate of mortality is diminishing for both sexes the interval is lengthening for
                                                                                    both.
For this reason, if it be treated as a constant quantity, deduced estimations of
                                                                                      the

aggregate of wealth, based upon any value founded on past experience, are con-
sequently unsatisfactory unless they are corrected for the increased " expectation
of life.'' The interval is, of course, the weighted average period between the suc-
cession to wealth in one generation and its passing on to the next.  The determina-
tion of the " weights" to be used in ascertaining the weighted average introduces
complexity into the method.
    There is a, fundamental defect in the devolution-interval method, which it is
important to consider. It is this                 —
                                    All wealth created during the life-time of any
                                              ;




individual obviously operates virtually as a reduction of the period intervening
between " successions." Thus this period, when exactly ascertained, should be
altered     by way   of correction.       The      data, however, furnish no information                     by means
of   which the necessary correction can be evaluated.
    Wealth that is conveyed during the lifetime of possessors causes estimates of
the total deduced from a correct estimate of the devolution-interval to be under-
stated.      The matter       is   later considered in detail.

       4.    The   devolution-rate.     —^The fundamental conception                     of the devolution-rate
method       of estimating the aggregate wealth                  is   that the persons dying during any
period constitute a " fair sample" of the living, as regards the possession of wealth.
If   the wealth of those dying be known, that of those living could be deduced by
multiplying   by the ratio of the living to the dying. That proportion of the dying,
whose estates are sufficiently large to come under review in probate returns, give an
aggregate of wealth which is too small, and consequently the wealth of the remainder
must be estimated in order to furnish the total wealth of the dying.
      This then    is   the principle of the method.             In applying      it,   however,     it is   necessary
to bear in    mind that the         distribution of wealth varies according to both age                       and   sex,
and therefore the death of those dying should be dealt with according                                to age-groups
and for the sexes separately.
     If the period of review be short, one year for example, the infrequency of the
appearance of large estates in probate returns is such that it will occasion large
discrepancies in the result deduced for successive years, according as a large estate
appears, or does not appear, in the returns.   Consequently accurate results can be
expected only if the estimate is extended over a sufficient number of years. We
shall see later that this should be at least 10 years in Australia.  But since in 10
years values may change considerably, the result applies, not to any moment of

time, but represents rather in any community in which wealth is increasing                                          —
decennial average referable to a moment somewhat later than the mean of the period.
We may call this the weighted mean, the weighting factor being the wealth.
      This in brief     is   the principle.       But  matter is not quite so simple.
                                                           in detail, the
Account must be taken of the passing on     wealth before death, for this, by reducing
                                                           of
the wealth appearing in the probate-returns impairs their value as a " fair sample."
Moreover, it assumes that the death-rate depends solely upon age. If, however, the
                        —                              —
condition of Kfe as regards wealth is affected, those represented in probate-
returns are again, not a " fair sample" of all persons of the same sex and age. It
is then evident that before the method can be regarded as quite satisfactory these

features    must be examined and            corrections applied           if   necessary.

      5.    Comparison o£          Methods. —     It    will    be necessary,       later,      to   compare the
estimate of wealth obtained by means of the                           War      Census, with that obtained
from probate returns.              After a full exposition of the two,                  a,   part will be devoted
to   the discussion of any discrepancy between the results.                                   This   is   the more
necessary as the present instance                 is   believed to be unique in respect of                    making
such a comparison.

     1.  Legislation.                            —
                      The War Census was authorised by the Commonwealth War
Census Act 1915, assented to on the 23rd July, 1915.    This Act provided that it
" shall continue in operation during the continuance of the present war and no
longer, and that a census or censuses shall be taken in such States, Territories or
parts of the Commonwealth, and on such day or days, or within such period or
periods as the Governor-General appoints by proclamation."

     In accordance with this provision a. proclamation, issued on the 25th August,
1915 (see Commonwealth Gazette, 25. 8. '15, p. 1633), fixed the period for the
Census of 1915 as from 6th to 15th September. A further Act, the War Census Act
(No. 2) 1915, assented to on 6th September, 1915, required the transmission by post,
free of charge, of all papers provided for in the principal Act.

         Two        schedules to the principal Act furnished tentative forms of                                                      inquirj%           pro-

prescribed.  A regulation setting forth these forms of inquiry as amended in accord-
ance with the Act was issued on 10th August, 1915.

     4.  Staff.              —
                 For the work of tabulation, summary and analysis, a special tempor-
ary staH was engaged through the office of the Public Service Inspector, Melbourne.
Each candidate for employment was required to pass an elementary education test,
the main requirements of which were neatness and legibility in writing, and quickness
and accuracy in adding columns of figures and in making horizontal extensions.'-
                                                         —
The staff consisted of six divisions one for each State and each division was placed     —
in charge of an Assistant Supervisor, who was either a permanent or an " exempt"
officer^ of         the Bureau.               These assistant supervisors were placed imder the immediate
control of the permanent Supervisor of Census.                                      Each of the divisions was sub-
divided into groups of approximately ten men,                                     known as " sections," each group
being under the guidance of a senior officer,                                   known as a " section leader." The
       pay were 10s. per day for general hands, 123. per day for section leaders, and
rates of
2a. 6d.         per day for messenger boys.                    At   its   maximum        strength, the      War   Census    staff
totalled 550 persons of all grades.

isation and decentralisation, it was deemed desirable that the whole of the tabulation,
summary and analysis, should be carried out in Melbourne. Fortunately sufficient
space was obtainable in the building in which the Census and Statistics Bureau is
located, provided that two shifts were worked.       This was accordingly done, the
earlier shift working from 7.45 a.m. to 3.15 p.m., the later shift from 3.30 p.m. to
11.15 p.m.3




                        CHAPTER n.—RECRUITING AND WAR LOAN APPEALS.

           1.     General.       —     ^In   addition to the      work     originally outlined in the             War     Census
Act, and the regulations thereunder, supplementary duties devolved                                             upon the War
Census          staff, of     which the most important were                 :




                 (i.)   The    issue of recruiting appeals to all males                  between the ages         of 18   and   45,
                             and
                (ii.)   The issue        of   war loan appeals and prospectuses to persons who, accord-
                             ing to their wealth       and income card were shewn to be in possession of
                             £1000 or upwards.


       ^    The    large     number      of candidates   who   failed to pass this simple test        shewed the necessity which
existed for applying             it.

       'That is, a temporary officer whose services could be retained for a considerable period.
       'Owing to the generosity of the proprietor of the buildings, Mrs. Jane Hall, acting through her
local representative, Mr. R. G. Casey, the use of a considerable portion of the required space was ob-
tained rent free for a period of four months, the concession being made in view of the purpose for which
the premises were required.

       Theregulation referred to contained a provision that for the purposes of the
War   Census Act 1915, the transmission of the form to the nearest local recruiting

                                             Commonwealth     of Australia.

                                                     THE CALL TO ARMS.
Dear Sir,                                                        Prime Minister, 15th December. 1915.
    The present state      of war imperatively demands that the exercise of the full strength of the Empire
and   its Allies   should be put forth. In this way only can speedy victory be achieved and lasting peace
secured.
      If those rights and privileges for which Australian democracy has struggled so long and values
dearer than life itself are to be preserved, Prussian military despotism must be crushed once and for all.
      The resources of the Allies are more than adequate for this task, but thov must be marshalled. To
wage this war with less than our full strength is to commit national suicide bv slowly bleeding to death.
      Our soldiers have done great things in this war. They have carved f^'ir Aust'raUa a niche in the
Temple of the Immortals. Those who have died fell gloriously, but had the number of oxir forces been
doubled, many brave lives would have been spared, the Australian armies would long ago have been
camping in Constantinople, and the world war would have been practically over.
      We must put forth all oui- strength. The more men Australia sends to the front the less the danger
will be to each man.      Not only victory but safety belongs to the big battalions.
      Australia turns to you for help. We want more men. Fifty thousand (60,000) additional troops
are to be raised to form new units of the Expeditionary Forces.         Sixteen thousand (16 000) men are
                                                                                                      '

        Theae appeals were sent to               all   males between the ages of 18 and 45, other than
enemy subjects, who had furnished replies on the War Census personal card. The
total number of appeals so sent waa approximately 990,000.  Owing to the failure
of certain of those           communicated with               to reply, further inquiries             under registered
cover were sent to about 173,000 persons.

         War Loan Appeal. At the request of the Commonwealth Treasurer an
appeal to contribute to the War Loan of 1917 was sent out by the War Census staff
in January, 1917, to about 176,000 persons and companies resident or domiciled
in Australia,          whose net     assets as   shewn by       their    Wealth and Income Cards amounted
to or exceeded £1000.                The   following     is   a copy of this appeal        :




                              COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTBALIA WAR LOAN.
                                                   Fourth     Issue.
                                                 Commonwealth Treasury, Melbourne, 22nd December,                  1916.
       To
Dear    Sir or   Madam,
       1.   Your attention    is   invited to the fact that    tlie    Commonwealth   is   now     asking for subscriptions
to a    Fomth War  Loan.
                 duty of every person in Australia to do all that is possible to speedily bring victory to
       2. It is tile
British arms. Already there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are living but to one end
victory, which willresultintheoverthrowoftheaggressor,themaintenanceof the rights of the smaller
nations, and freedom from military despotism. Everything that we hold dear is involved in the
struggle. The right to govern ourselves, our means of livelihood, and our personal liberty are tlnreaten-
ed.   In view of the slave raids of the Huns, even association with the members of our own families
may be at stalce. Patriotism and self-interest alilse demand that we maintain the fight with all our
strength.
     3. The provision of funds is just as necessary as the provision of men, and most urgently are you
appealed to for assistance. You are asked to exercise self-denial and to contribute as much of your
funds as possible towards the War Loan. You are asked to realize that on you depends sometliing.
To some extent at least the proper maintenance of the fight depends upon you. If you do not give
for the purpose of the war as much money as you can give, then you cannot say to yourself that you
have done as well as you should have done. Thousands ot others., are doing all that they can, please
do your share.
    4. The terms of the loan have been so arranged that comparatively poor persons may subscribe.
Those who cannot afford more, most probably could in ten months find £10, paying £1 per month.
The enclosed prospectus gives all further particulars in relation to the Loan.
    5. Do not forget it is every man's duty to subscribe
the citizens of a nation victorious and at peace.
                                                                        —

                         CHAPTER           m.—MALES               OF MILITARY AGE.
      1. General.         —
                    On the receipt of the War Census Cards, the work first undertaken
was that of classifying and tabulating the data relative to males of miUtary age, that
is, between the ages of 18 and 60.     The whole of the War Census Staff was con-
sequently first employed on the classification and tabulation of the personal cards,
which were furnished in respect of males whose age last birthday was not less than
18 nor more than 59.

    2.                               —
        Enemy origin.- -The cards were sorted initially into three main groups
according to whether the persons enumerated were or were not of enemy origin. In
one group were placed the cards relating to persons of enemy birthplace, in another
those relating to persons of                enemy parentage but not enemy                      birthplace, while the
third and largest group contained all the remainurg cards, i.e., all the cards relating
to persons who were of neither enemy birthplace nor enemy parentage.

     Of the malea of enemy birthplace of military age, 63 per cent, were between the
ages of 18 and 45. The corresponding proportion in the case of those of enemy
parentage, but not enemy birthplace, was 75^ per cent., while in the case of those
of neither enemy birthplace nor enemy parentage the proportion was shghtly
under 74 per cent.

                                                              who were   of military age   were
     This indicates that the males of    enemy   birthplace
on the average   of   more advanced age than those    in the other   two groups.

         Conjugal condition and dependents. A tabulation of the data relative to
conjugal condition and dependents was made only in the case of those persons who,
in respect of health, were classified as " fit."  These, as indicated in Section 3
above, comprised 843,264 persons, and represented 62J per cent, of the total recorded
between the ages of 18 and     60.


     Classified according to conjugal condition the particulars relative to " fit"         men
of military age are as follows   :

4 per cent, of the total, while saw-millers and their employees numbered 20,991, or
1 J per cent. It will thus be seen that the four leading branches of primary production
accounted for no fewer than 386,090, or 28J per cent, of the total males of military
age recorded.

lexicographically arranged card index        was prepared in respect   of the   1,349,597
personal cards, and changes of address numbering          thousands were made

both on the record and the index cards. Complete lists of persons of enemy
birthplace and parentage were prepared for the information of the military
authorities, and a record was made of the names and addresses of owners of arms
and ammunition and the nimiber and amovmt so          held.

                                                                            income of
     1.  General.—Before any satisfactory classification of the wealth or
the community could be made on a progressive basis, it was necessary to devise a
scheme for the grouping of the data in such a manner as to obviate as fully as practic-
able the possibilities of duplication on the one hand or omission on the other.



     2.     Groups adopted.           —
                                For this purpose the wealth and income cards were
                                                                                                                       —
initially   divided into six main groups, with supplementary sub-groups as follows                                 :




             I.   Individual Males.                              IV. (A.) Trustees.
            II.   Individual Females.                                     Male Beneficiaries.
                                                                        (B.)
           III. (A.)     Partnerships.                                    Female Beneficiaries.
                                                                        (C.)
                  (B.)   Male Partners.                           V. Companies.
                  (C.)   Female Partners.                        VI. Institutions.



     3.     Individuals.    —   ^In   Divisions      I.    and   II.   were included at the        initial   operation
those cards and those only which related to individual persons                                   who   furnished no
evidence of being interested in a trust estate, whether as a trustee or as a beneficiary,
or in a partnership.  At a later stage when the check purposes of the initial sorting
had been served, the individual cards relating to partners and to beneficiaries were
combined with those            initially classed in Divisions I.               and   II.

     In principle, Divisions              I.   and   II.   were    identical, the          only distinction between
them being the           difference of sex, Division              I.   relating to males        and Division II. to
females.



    4.                         —
         Partneishlps. All cards relating to partnerships as well as all indi^ddual
cards relating to the male or female partners were initially classed in Division III.,
the object of this primary classification being that of enabling the cards relating to
partnerships to be compared with those relating to the individual partners. As
indicated above the cards relating to partners were eventually classed with those
relating to individuals.   In the case of firms trading in Australia but domiciled
outside the Commonwealth, the card relating to the firm was the only card furnished.
In these cases the partnership cards were separately tabulated and the results appear
in the  tables under the designation " Non-resident partnerships."    Partnerships
domiciled in Australia, being included in respect both of wealth and income in the
returns of the individual partners, are omitted from the tables.



      5.     Trusts.     —AH    cards containing particulars relative to a trust were placed
originally in Division IV.,          and were subsequently sorted into the three sub-groups
                male beneficiaries, (c) female beneficiaries. In certain cases the card
(a) trustees, (6)
furnished by a trustee contained the pnrticulara of his or her own private wealth and
income in the inner column, and those relative to the trust estate in the outer column
of the card, in other oases a separate card was fm'nished in respect of the trust.

Where the combined           cards had been furnished a separate card waa written by the
War                                                   which were then deleted from the
      Censiis staff in respect of the trust particulars,
trustee's card.      the trustee was not interested as a beneficiary in this or any other
                      If
trust estate or in a partnership, his or her amended card waa forthwith transferred
to Division    I.   or II., as the case might be.         The   object of associating the cards
relating to trust estates with those relating to beneficiaries was, aa in the case of
partnerships, to allow of a check being obtained.                Owing   to the impossibility of
obtaining in respect of trust estates a satisfactory evaluation of the shares of the
several beneficiaries,       it    was deemed expedient to eliminate from the returns of
individual beneficiaries                  shewn as consisting of interests in trust estates, and
                                  all assets

to shew the value of trust estates in bulk. In addition to such trust property there
is a large body of assets held in a fiduciary capacity by life assurance and other
societies which cannot be allocated to individual proprietors owing to the fact that
particulars in respect of the values of policies were advisedly excluded               from the
inquiry.    The     total value of sxich property, aggregating approximately £52,000,000,
has in the final results been incorporated with the bulk statement of Trust Funds.
Similarly the net income of such societies has been included in bulk in the income
statement. In this connection it may be noted that in so far as premium income of
these societies is concerned, each individual furnishing an income return was instructed
amongst other things to deduct from his gross income the amount paid in respect
of such    premiums.



      6.   Companies.      —
                       ^In the initial sorting all cards relating to companies were

classed together, and were subsequently divided into two groups according to whether
their head offices were within or outside of Australia.  As the dividends paid by the
companies will appear in the returns of the shareholders receiving them, and the
value of the shares and debentures of the companies will appear in the assets of their
shareholders,   it is   clear that special precautions are necessary to avoid duplication in
the compilation of         company
                           returns. With this object in view a special tabulation
was made                  shewn on the cards as comprising shares and debentures
             of the total assets
of companies, and a special return was obtained from all Australian companies
shewing the undistributed profit during the year under review, including sums
transferred to reserves.  In the final tabulation of the results the net assets of all
companies were reduced by the amount of shares and debentures in companies
shewn as being held in AustraUa, the balance representing approximately the amount
of outside capital mvested in companies operating in Australia.       In the case of
income, the wealth and income card did not furnish a means of determining the total
income derived from dividends of companies. The special return of undistributed
profit mentioned above was consequently taken as furnishing for Australian com-
panies the net income not included in shareholders' retxuTis, while for companies
having their head offices outside of Australia the total net projits were taken into
account.



      7.   Institutions.   —
                        ^Returns fumiahed by such institutions and bodies as churches,
schools, mechanics'  and literary institutes, sports clubs, etc., were aU classed under
the comprehensive head of " institutions," the number of these being considerable.
In very many cases there waa, strictly speaking, no net income, aa the gross income
received was practically all absorbed in the working expenses for the year. In not a
few cases also, there was little in the nature of net assets, the liabilities representing
a large proportion of the gross assets. For the whole of Australia, this division
represented net income of about £600,000 and net assets of about £25,000,000.

                                                                              respect of
     1.  According to States.— (i.) Total Net Income. In the inquiry in
wealth and income made by the War Census, provision was made for the record of
the State in which the person making the return waa residing, but no provision for
the allocation of the income to the States in which it was earned or for the allocation
of the wealth to the States in which it was situated.    The tabular results, therefore,
in respect of the several States, must be understood merely as giving particulars in
respect of States of domicile of the earners of the income or the owners of the wealth.^

     In the cases of absentees the States to which the returns have been allocated
are those in which the Australian representative of the absentee was domiciled.
Similarly the returns for Australian companies, partnerships and institutions have
been allocated to the States in which their respective head offices are situated, while
the returns for companies and partnerships domiciled outside Australia have been
allocated to the States in which their head offices for Australia are situated.

     On this basis, and in accordance with the classification of ownership indicated in
Chapter IV., the following classification of income according to States has been
compiled. In all cases the figures shewn represent the net income, that is, the
deductions indicated in the income section of the Wealth and Income Card (see p. 9)
have been made in all cases before tabulation.

            Particulars concerning the    number   of returns relative to     residents   and non-

       The aggregate net income represented by the returns specified in the foregoing
table   was £240,163,204, of which the sum of £201,502,697 was recorded in the cards
of   males, while the cards of females accounted for £38,660,507.   The average net
income per card for resident males was thus £146, as compared with an average per
card of £48 for resident females, and an average for residents of both sexes of £110.
The aggregate net income for each income group, and the proportion per cent, in
each case     is   given in the following table in respect of persons actually or usually
resident in Australia      :

                                               In the tabulation of data relative to
income, etc., in groups, an approximation to the aggregate amount represented by
each group is sometimes obtained by ascertaining the number of returns in each
group, and then multiplying by some factor which lies between the limits of the group,
frequently by the mean of those limits.   Such a method reduces the work enormous-
ly, but lacks accuracy, and on the present occasion was not adopted.      The process
followed was that of adding together all the net incomes shewn on the returns for
each group. The average net incomes per return deduced from these aggregates are
shewn   in the following table   :

              The net     assets   shewn        in the preceding table -are exclusive of the proijerty of
      Federal, State or Local Governments, and   may consequently be considered as repre-
      senting the total private wealth of Australia as at 30th June, 1915. This total of
      £1,643,463,376 includes the Australian property of non-resident individuals, partner-
      ships and companies.     The amount, however, so held by non-residents, cannot be
      determined with any degree of accuracy, but on the basis of the War Census returns
      it is roughly estimated that it lies between £150,000,000 and £200,000,000.     It
      would thus appear that the aggregate private wealth of Australian residents as at
      30th June, 1915, was approximately £1,470,000,000. or nearly £300 per head of
      population.



           As in the case of incomes in Chapter II., the assets of Australian partnerships
      are included in the returns of the individual partners.
                                                                   The partnerahip figures
      shewn in the above table relate to non-resident partnershijis only.


          The item " Trust Funds," is made up of several categories of
                                                                        which the most
      important are the total values of trust-estates, and the Australian
                                                                          fvmds of Life
      Assurance Companies, Friendly Societies, and Trade Unions.



           As these funds were in every case excluded from the returns of
                                                                             individuals either
      by instruction as in the case of Life Assurance policies, etc.,

      pnor to tabulation as in the case of beneficiaries in trust estates,
                                                                              the possibilitv of
      duplication of such returns has been eliminated.

        In the case of " Companiea," the net assets of the Australian companies were
    taken from special returns obtained from these companies, such net assets being
    computed without deducting the liabiUties to share and debenture holders. From
    the total net assets so computed, the aggregate amount of " Shares and debentures
    in companies" shewn on the various individual and other cards was deducted, the
    balance representing approximately the interest in Australian companies held by-
    persons not resident in the Commonwealth, together with the margin, if any, be-
    tween the share valuations of the se\'eral shareholders, and the valuation         of net
    assetsmade by the company officials.

(        With absentee companies, that is, companies registered outside Australia, but
t   trading in the Commonwealth, the procedure followed was that of including the net
V   assets of the company held in AustraUa.

of £500  and upwards, while about 14J per cent, of those relative to resident females
were in respect of net assets of £500 and upwards. For the sexes combined net
assets of £500 and upwards were represented by somewhat less than 17J per cent, of
the returns.



     The aggregate net assets represented by the returns shewn in the preceding

                                                         A Census hurriedly taken
under war conditions cannot compare for completeness and accuracy with one taken
by a large number of systematically organised " Collectors," who see that each re-
sponsible person makes the necessary reply to the questions asked. In the case of the
War Census the duty of making returns was perforce cast upon each individual. It
becomes necessary therefore to gauge the measure of the completeness of the result.
This can be roughly done by ascertaining the numbers in each State who failed to
make a return, and comparing them with the numbers of all under the age of 21,
many of which would presumably have no return to make.           It may be noted on
the one hand that in the case of females a large proportion of adults will have no
returns to make since they have neither wealth nor income, and on the other
hand that juniors   will frequently    have to make returns for the reason that they
have one or both.    The   result of the comparison referred to is as follows    :




     Table shewing the Analysis oJ the     Number   oS Returns for the   War   Census.
                             Special Classes of Assets.                                    37


    The lower line denotes the proportion which the male "excess"         referred to bears
to thenumber of males making returns.
     Regarding the point that all adults might be expected to have made a return, it
may be  noted on the one hand that there were on 30th June, 1915, 48,456 male, and
62,853 female pensioners, who probably can be taken as possessing neither property
nor income and on the other hand, account should also be taken of the fact that all
             ;


persons of age 18 and upwards were required to make returns, and also juniors
possessed of either.  Again, old persons, not pensioners, living with their relatives,
would often belong to the class possessing neither property nor income. The numbers
of male, female and total pensioners in each State are shewn in the table on page 36.

     No   exact estimate can be    made   of the defects in the returns either in respect of
numbers or amomits represented, but what has been adduced shews that the whole
measure of the uncertainty is negligible as compared with that due to unavoidable
limitations in the estimates of values, and perhaps also as to the amounts of income.

     Under    these circumstances has been considered advisable not to attempt any
                                    it

correction of the results obtained by tabulation of the returns received. It may be
noted that in many cases returns, often of small amounts, were received in respect
of children under 18, the particulars being furnished sometimes on a parent's card,
and sometimes on a separate card.




                    CHAPTER IV.—SPECIAL CLASSES OF ASSETS.

     1.  General.  —As indicated in the preceding chapter, the principal tabulations
of the Wealth Census data were based upon (a) States of residence, (6) Grades of
ownership, and (c) Size of net tissets. For certain purposes, it was deemed desirable
to tabulate the gross amounts of assets shewn under some of the items, but owing to
the expense that would be involved, a complete tabulation of aU the items was not
undertaken. The items specially tabulated were {a) Cash in hand, (6) Shares and
debentures in companies,     (c)   Land-values.

     2.                  —
         Cash in hand. ^Various estimates have been made from time to time of
the amount of coin in circulation in Australia, but the figures quoted have differed
considerably.  The average amount held by the banks in each quarter is published
regularly, but the amount in the hands of the public has proved       difficult to   determine
with any degree of accuracy.
    In 1892 the manager of one of the Sydney banks estimated the amount of coin
in privatehands in New South Wales at £725,000, or 12s. 5d. per head. At the same
date the amount of bank notes in circulation in New South Wales was approximately
£1,500,000, making on the basis of the coin estimate quoted a total circulation in the
hands of the public of £2,225,000, or £1 18s. Id. per head of population.
     In 1906 the Deputy-master of the Perth branch of the Royal Mint conducted an
inquiry concerning the amount of coin in circulation in the hands of the public in
Australia, and as a result gave an estimate of £4,200,000, or £1 Os. 8d. per head.
According to this estimate the gold coin in circulation amounted to £3,000,000,
while the silver and copper coin amounted to £1,200,000. At the same date the
amount of bank notes and of Queensland Treasury notes in the hands of the public
was approximately £3,900,000. This would give a total circulation for Australia of
£8,100,000, or £1 19s. lid. per head of population, of which silver and copper coin
represented  53. lid. per head.

     According to the estimate of the Commonwealth Treasury, it appears that
                                                                                  at the

28th June, 1915, the amount of Australian notes in the hands of the public waa
£8,626,508, or £1 14s. lOd. per head of population.      If it be assumed that at that

date there waa no gold in circulation, and that the silver and copper coin in the hands
of the public was on the same basis as in the 1906 Mint estimate, the
                                                                         amount of cir-
culation in the hands of the public worlds out at £2 Os. 9d. per head of
                                                                            population,

as compared with an estimate for Australia of £1 19s. lid. in 1906, and an estimate
for New South Wales of £1 18s. Id. in 1892.
                                                                    "
     In view of these estimates it would appear that the figures for Cash in hand"
furnished on the Wealth Census Cards were considerably below the truth, even when
allowance   is   made   for the fact that the returns are for part of the population only.
The tabulated     results   were as follows   :

     3. Shaies and debentures in companies.—As indicated in Chapter III. (p. 29), the

tabulation of data concerning shares and debentures in companies was undertaken
mainly   for the   purpose of enabling an appropriate allowance to be made in the wealth
returns to avoid the inclusion of     company assets twice over. The totals obtained
were as follows      :

42                     War    Census of   1915.       Wealth and Income.

    A comparison of the figures furnished by the War Census tabulation and those
given by the Commonwealth Land Tax assessments indicates that there is not any
marked deviation between the two sets of results in so far as estates having an un-
improved value of £5000 and upwards is concerned. The Commonwealth taxation
returns are not, of course, on all fours with the War Census returns, owing in part to
the procedure which must be followed in accumulating the landed property of in-
dividual landholders for taxation purposes, and in part to the fact that the taxation
returns refer to taxable Crown leases as well as to freehold properties.    As an ex-
ample of the effect of the principle of accumulation, the case may be cited of a land-
holder who has a freehold of £4000 unimproved value in his own right, and is to the
extent of £2000 unimproved value interested as a shareholder in a company. For
taxation purposes his estate would be classed as exceeding £5000, while in the War
Census returns he would be tabulated as under £5000.

     The total unimproved value of estates of £5000 unimproved value and upwards
was shewn by the War Census returns as £179,668,830. The unimproved value as
returned by owners for Commonwealth taxation purposes for the year 1914-15 was
£189,652,780, while the value ascertained by the Taxation Department was

of course, accord at all closely with the returns of live stock collected annually in
respect of those States.   The War Census aggregates of horses, cattle and sheep for
the whole of Australia are, however, in fair agreement with the aggregates obtained
from the annual returns. It is thus evident that no useful purpose would be served
by publishing the figures for a smaller area than the Commonwealth as a whole.

means of transport that were available in Australia, each person was asked to fur-
nish on his Wealth and Income Card the number, purpose, horse-power, etc., of any
vehicles in his possession.



     The geographical distribution of the data is, in this case as in all the others,
dealt with in theWealth Cens\js Eiccording to domicile of the owners, not according
to the location of the vehicles.            Although there are probably      many   cases in which
vehicles situated in one State are the property                  of   persons resident in another
State, such instances are not nearly so numerous as is the case with live stock, and
consequently the figures obtained for the several States and Territories may be taken
as furnishing a rough indication of the geographical distribution of the vehicles
themselves. On this account the figures for States and Territories are given in the
succeeding tables        :

       CHAPTER I.—THE CORRELATION OF WEALTH AND INCOME.

The War Census, as already pointed out, did not include all, but included the great
majority of the persons   who were   required to   make   returns.   In the following table

            the distribution of these   is   given according to ranges of income and ranges of assets,
            the aggregates for each range of income, and for each range of assets being also shewn.

                 If these distributions conformed perfectly to curves of a known type it would
            be possible to compute the mutual relations of wealth and income. Owing to limita-
            tions of numbers, however, and to the incompleteness of the returns, the progressions
            of the numbers only approximate to well-defined (and smooth) curves.

                 The figures given in this part relative to income and assets relate in each case to
             " net income'' and " net assets."

and £150 amongst females         are very largely derived     from 'personal exertion. It may
be noted in      this connection that 80 per cent, of the       male returns received, and 69
per cent, of the male income recorded,         lie   between the income limit.s of £50 and £300.



     Incomes below £50 and above £300 are much more largely derived from property
than  is the case with the incomes mentioned above, and consequently in these cases

the percentages obtained approach more nearly to the rates of profit derivable from
the investment of capital.       Probably in no class is the personal element entirely
eliminated, and hence all the percentages shewn will probably exhibit an advance on
normal rates of profit. For incomes above £500 the percentage for males for the
whole Commonwealth varies from 14.09 per cent, to 8.72 per cent., while in the
similar field for females the variation is between 12.50 per cent, and 7.88 per cent.

tabulated.   Some idea, however, can be had of the relative positions between
Prussia in 1911, and Australia in 191 -1-5, as regards wealth and associated income.



     The Statistical Year-books for Prussia, containing returns relating to the Prussian
Income Tax and Property Tax, furnish the values of incomes and of property. The
1912 volume gives incomes said to be for the year 1912, and the 1913 volume ampli-
fies the values of property, said to be for 1911, which are commenced in the 1912

volume. It appears, however, from a table on page 301, that, so far as the Property
Tax     is   concerned, an assessment   is   made once    in three years.   There are figures   for
the individual years 1905 and 1906, but subsequent figures relate to the periods
1899-1901, 1902-04, 1905-07, 1908-10, and 1911-13. It may, therefore, be reasonably
assumed that the Property Tax Returns (said to be for 1911) can be applied to either
of the three years 1911, 1912, or 1913, and that they refer to the same population
as the Income Tax Returns (said to be for the year 1912).




       The income     figures are given for six large groups subdivided into a large     number
•of   smaller groups, rising   by £15 up     to £225, then   by £25   to £475,   and then by £50,
£75, and £100 to £5000, etc., etc.  The property figures are given for eight large
groups subdivided into a large number of smaller groups, rising by £100 up to
£1200, then by £200 up to £3000, then by £500 to £10,000, by £1000 to £50,000, and
afterwards by larger amounts.



     It may also reasonably be assumed that the 1,767,034 persons with property
exceeding £300 are contained in the 6,906,497 persons with incomes exceeding £45,
but, apart from the fact that it is a fair assumption that the four persons with the
largest incomes (total £2,152,500) are the same four persons who are possessed of the
largest properties (total £42,599,000), it cannot be assumed that the persons in any
one group of incomes wholly correspond to the persons in any group of property,
and certainly as the incomes become smaller this observation more and more strongly
applies.
  62                            The Relation between Wealth and Income.

           In the table hereunder the results are compiled according to the range of income
  shewn       in column (ii.), the corresponding number of persons being shewn m
  column      (i.).      For the wealth possessed by identical numbers of persons, the aggre-
  gates were                   the bottom of column (i.), the corresponding aggregates
                      made up from
  of wealth being             column (v.). This enabled the average income and average
                               shewn    in
  wealth of each class to be ascertained. As already stated, the individual persons in
  column (i. are not the same for the wealth aggregates as for the income aggregates,
                 )


  that is, they are identical nimibers of persons, but are not identical persons, and prob-
  ably the non-identity as to persons greatly increases for the larger numbers (in the
  higher parts of the table).         Hence the ratio of the averages does not represent the
  ratio of the        income accruing to the groups of persons possessing given aggregates of
  wealth.


      The table is nevertheless of value as shewing independently the average incomes
  enjoyed and average wealth possessed by separate groups of equal numbers of people
  more or less differently constituted as regards the individual incomes and the in-
  dividual aggregates of wealth.


         The results in the            final   column (ix. are deduced in a similar way from Australian

                                                                       ascertained      ;



ranges of income are the same throughout, and the ranges of asset are also the same
throughout (the two not necessarily being equal), these numbers can be represented
as a system of parallelepipeds on the double-ranges as basic areas.   They thus form
a species of " stepped" surface, which, when the ranges of income and asset are both
made     indefinitely small,          becomes a continuous or smooth                  surface.        We     shall con-
sider the natm'e of this surface.
     In order to fully exhibit the correlation of income and asset, and consequently
to fully appreciate the significance of the tables of  Chapter I. of this part, section
1,  it is necessary    to ascertain the (average) frequency with which a given
amount of wealth is associated with a given income.        Since for a given income the
numbers (N) included in small ranges of wealth vary (sensibly) as the ranges and                                   —
the same observation applies also when, for a given amount of wealth incomes are
considered, it follows that the number of persons in each double-entry range must be
divided by the product of the corresponding range of wealth and range of income, in
order to exhibit the comparable frequencies.    The quotient is the average per square
unit (wealth by income) throughout the double range (roughly at the common centre
of the two ranges).   Or since S N--c 8x, and as Sij, therefore as Oxoy, we shall have
for    the vertical height        z.



            (1)         z   = 8N           / (Sx8y);       or z^   =   T^ bcvi   /   (*<:   "   **)   (^/a

are those of the range of income for the number of persons N.                 Obviously
2 = / (a;, y), and if we can ascertain this function, we shall be able to determine the

values for any ranges whatsoever, since

question, and ^ denotes the proportion of this to the population P.   In this case the
value of the double-integral between the widest possible limits is taken as unity.
       The data from which the wealth-and-income surface can be deduced is shewn in
the following tables, which give the     number of males and females respectively, out
of   a recorded total of 1,380,208 males, and 811,737 females, whose incomes and whose
assets each range through £1 sterling at a position approximately at the centre of the
several ranges.    In order to reduce the number of decimals to be expressed, the
quantities found  by dividing the product of each range of income by the range of the
corresponding asset have all been multiplied by 1000. The tabular quantities
therefore are 1000 times the average taken over eaxih range of income and its associ-
ated range of asset.^  I shall call this surface the plutoprosodic surface.                             ^        It is    not
very regular, but can be defined with considerable precision.

     1. Instead oi regarding these quantities as referable to the centres of the ranges, in order to define
the continuous wealth-and-income (plul oprosodic) surface, the result will be more satisfactory, bxit not
quite correct if rcjferred to the average values of income and average values of asset. Thelabour of
applying necessarily small corrections to these results in order to make them rigorously accurate is not             ,

justified, in view of the various limitations of the data, sec figures 2 and 3, page"66, shewing the
surface.   If the quantities in the table are divided by 1,000, they give the numliors of males and fe-
males who are included on the average in a range of .c to .r + 1 pounds sterlins income, and « to ti + 1
pounds aterliTig wealth the average extending all over the double-range A'l to A'a and I\ to r^.

     The iipp?r fisure (1) shews the cnntours of tha plutopro jodic surface for males, based upon
1,380,208 War Census returns for males, and the lower figure (2) the phitoprosortic surface for females,
based upon 811,737 War Census returns for females. The frequencies indicating vertical heights are aa
shewn by figures written on the contour lines. These denote the number of persons in the totals con-
sidered, multiplied by 1000, for a range of £1 of wealth and £1 of income.       The intersection of the
vertical lines with the contours shews the frequency with variations of income for given values of wealth.
Similarly, the intersections of the horizontal lines with the contours shew the frequency for given
incomes with variations of the amount of \\'ealth.

     Where the ranges of wealth or imome, or both, are more extended than one pound sterling, tiie
frequency numbers should be multiplied by the product of the two ranges and divided by 1000.
Thus, if the range of wealth be from £7000 to £7500. and that of income from £500 to £510, the
multiplier will be 500 x 10 = 5000.   This divided by 1000 gives 5, the factor to be multiplied into
the frequency value as shewn. It will be sufficiently accurate to adopt the value of the contour pass-
ing through the centre of the range-area in question. For males this is approximately '2A6         the
                                                                                                    ;

requiredfrequency will be 0.864 x 5 = 4.32.
     It will be observed that the surface for males is fairly regular, hut that for females is very
irregular.  The irregularities are probably accidental, and with larger numbers would most likely
disappear.

    The values   of ciurves   a      i   have been referred to in the preceding paragraph.
     The plutoprosodic sarface, it will be seen, represents the whole system of relations that exist
between wealth and income, by means of a three dimensional figure on which the contours are the

     THE ESTIMATION OF WEALTH FROM PROBATE RETURNS.


                    CHAPTER I.— THE INTERVAL OF DEVOLUTION.


     1,                                                    —
         The interval oJ devolution method. The method of determining the aggre-
gate of private wealth from the aggregate amoiint appearing as inheritance, by taking
account of the average interval between the inheritance and the passing on of an
estate, ur the average interval between " successions to title," is known as the
" interval of devolution'' method. It is a method that has been used more frequently
than any other. We shall consequently refer to it at some length, and may point out
that it has recently been discussed by Mallet, ^ and very fully and more recently

by Corrado Gini. ^
     In this method, aa employed by Mony, 1877, and by Bailleux de Marisy, 1878,
it was assumed that the mean duration of life could be regarded as the devolution
interval.  Ten years later Verrijn Stuart, viz., in 1888, made the same assumption,
as also did F .S. Nitti quite recently, " viz., in 1904. In December, 1878, L. Vacher
pointed out that the devolution-interval should be the arithmetic mean between the
times when persons receive, and when they transmit to their heirs, their inheritances.
     This suggested the idea that a fundamental period to be ascertained was the
"duration of a generation" determined aa the interval between the births of parents
and children, but it was demonstrated by Coletti that increase in the duration of life
could sensibly disturb the coincidence of the interval between the births and that
between the deaths. It was simultaneously pointed out by Oini, and by Lavergne
and Henry, 1908, that there is a sensible difference between the interval from the
deaths of parents to the deaths of children, and the interval between the deaths
of testators and the deaths of their heirs in fact, that the latter interval is appreci-
                                                       ;



ably shorter owing to the influence of " successions" by collateral relatives, the
widowed, and 'strangers in blood.' Mallet, in 1908, ascertained the devolution-
interval by computing the mean duration of the life of heirs by means of hte-tal^les.
In 1909, March indicated another method based upon the difference in the mean age
of testators and the mean age of their heirs (interoalle moyen des mutations siiccessives).

     It was not long before it was perceived that the amoimt of the " succession"
was of importance in forming the " average interval." Jlony, Bailleux de Jlarisy
and Vacher took cognisance of this, and de Fo^'ille shewed that it is also necessary
to add the amount of settlements (donazioni), which are, of course, virtually anticipa-
tions of inheritance.

      Gini shewed that the interval between two settlementa was sensibly equal to the
intervalbetween two successions. Attempts to evade the pajTnent of duty reduce
the amount coming into evidence, and Vacher endeavoxured accordingly to ascertain
                                                                   —
the magnitude of the evasions, with the result that he and others also ^foundthat     —
the ascertained amounts did not agree with the estimations made by officials of
various departments of Finance.    In the attempt to obtain a multiplier from the
average devolution-interval for individual estates, Gini pointed out that the arith-
metic   mean    isunsatisfactory, and that the harmonic mean should be used        and       ;


further, that   many estates are ceded by persons of advanced age against service to be
rendered to    them or   their descendants    ;   and yet again, that it   is   very important that
account should be talcen of the influence on the annual amount of devolution of
variations in the wealth of a country.            No method   is   quite free from this difficulty.

        Determmation oJ the interval of devolution. The duration of a generation,
regarded as the interval between two successive generations, was determined directly
by Turquan. X'sing 4i million schedules, he computed that from years 1892 to 1896
the average age of fathers of " legitimates" (so-called) in France, was 33 years
7 months, and that of mothers of " legitimates" 29 years 10 months 13 days.
In the following table the results are given for a number of countries, as well as the
period to which these dates apply     :

and that of the middle child is presumed to be sufficiently well ascertained. B.iimelin
found the interval between marriage and the birth of the first child to be one year
between the births of first and last child 12.2 to I2..5 years  ; and thus the interval
between marriage and the birth of the middle child to be slightly over 7 years. By
this method he calculated the average interval between the births of parents and of
children to be aa follows      :
                                   —
                               Germany, 36.5     England, 35.5
                                                 ;                  France, 34.5 years.

This method is, of course, not accurate, because the interval between marriage and
the birth of the first child cannot be regarded as exactly one year. Four years'
experience in Australia, for example, gives the result 1.19 years, and shews that the
interval varies with the age of the parent (in this case the mother), the result being
as follows   :

                                =   J      (19     + 29 + 39) +                   1(1 + 2+4 + 8 + 11 + 3 + 5)                    =   33.9.


Thus Vacher gives a larger number than Riimelin, and Riimelin a larger number than
Turquan.

       The data         and also for New South Wales shew that the results obtained
                       for Paris
according to Turquan'a    and Vacher's methods are not the same, the difference for
Paris amounting to 2.6 years for males, and 3.5 years for females and in New South                                     ;


Wales to 2.7 years for males, and 2.9 for females. In this instance Gini states that
Riimelin's method cannot be employed.

     In discussing which of the three methods is preferable, Gini makes observations
that  may be summarised as follows                                           —
                                          From the demographic point of view the
                                                                         :




difference between ages of parents and children is of importance, as this is the interval
between two generations     and the schematic example given indicates that it might
                                              ;


be obtained as follows                :




            A (1890 + 1891 + 1893 + 1897 + 1900 + 1893 + 1895)                                            — i (1870+1861) = 28.6                      ;




the first part denoting the years of birth of sons (7)                                             and the      latter of the fathers (2).
From the economic point                           of view,          i.e.,     in the case of the valuation of the private
wealth of a country, Gini affirms that                                        it is     important to recognise that                    :




       If   the property         left      by a person              is       derived entirely from his own thrift, then the
amount       of the properties left at their deaths                                by the children of two generations will
be in proportion to their numbers.                                   In that case the method                     of    Turquan should be
used, as it takes the age of parents into account every time they                                                  have children.

       Butof properties left to successors it not infrequently happens (in Europe at
least)that only a relatively small portion is due to thrift, the greater portion having
been inherited. The amount of property, left by the children at their deaths will
therefore be less than proportionate to their number.        Turquan's method would,
therefore,        by taking the            interval between the births of parents                                 and children, furnish
too small a result for the calculation of the private wealth.

     It ought also to be observed that in order, at any given moment, to obtain the
average devolution-interval (denoted by Gini by i^) we must determine the mean
interval between the births of parents and children, not merely for those persons who
actually register children, but for those persons                                            who   actually die.            In the meantime

72                      The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns.

     The whole position may, therefore, be summed up as follows           The vanoua    :   —
methods (Vacher, Riimehn, Turquan) adopted in the determination of the duration
of generations are not at all equivalent, and lead to sensibly different results. For

the purpose of the calculation of private wealth none of them is exact, as the result
according to Tiu-quan is too small, and according to Vacher and Bilmelin too large.
It is, therefore, necessary to be satisfied with rough approximations.     In another
direction, a source of error lies in the fact that in the case of persona dying the interval
between births of parents and births of children is taken as equal to that found for
persons who at that time register the birth of children.


    Those who deduce the interval of devolution from the interval between the birth
of parentsand the birth of children, regard this latter aa coinciding with the interval
between the death of parents who have survived grand-parents and the deaths of
children          who    survive parents.


     Setting the data out in the form of inequalities, Gini has                shewn that       :




            (a) If it     be assumed that the interval between the death of parents and the
                       death of surviving children corresponds to the interval between the
                       birth of parents and the birth of their children, an error is made which,
                       according to the nature of the cases, may lie in either direction, but the
                       amount of which is generally not very serious.

            (6) If     the     mean duration   of life  remain constant, the interval between the
                       birth of parents and the birth of their children   is greater than the inter-

                       val between the death of      parents and the death of surviving children.

            (c)   If    the    mean duration   of life increase, there may be a difference in the
                       opposite direction.     It will certainly  be an advantage if the increase
                       in the duration of life can be taken into account.     But we have to con-
                       aider that the influence of that increase is more complex than has hitherto
                       been believed, and that the increase in the mean duration of life is
                       different, and probably very different (?) in the case of heirs from that
                       of the total population {op. cit., pp. 60, 61).    This deduction is of
                       doubtful application in Australia.

     He  adds further that those authors who have calculated private wealth by the
method   of the interval of devolution have assumed that this interval corresponds
to the mean interval between the death of parents leaving property and the death of
children inheriting property, an hypothesis, however, which he points out is not in
accordance with reality (tale ipotesi non corrisponde a realtd).   He has shewn by an
example which, though only schematic, leads to substantially correct conclusions,
that the interval of devolution is notably smaller than tlie interxal between the death
of parents leaving property and the death of children inheriting {ibid., pp. 61-63).

     Dividing testators into three classes, viz. (i.) married or widowed persons with
issue   (ii.) married or widowed persons without issue
        ;                                                  and (iii.) unmarried persons
                                                                     ;



and making certain suppositions which, even when they are not strictly true, do not
sensibly prejudice the result, he establishes mathematically that the interval of
devolution is appreciably smaller than the mean interval between the deaths of
parents and the deaths of their cOiildren. These suppositious are                   :




            (a)   That tho possessors     of property of      one generation die before those of the
                       following generation    ;   he discusses also the limitations to this supposi-
                       tion.

          (6)    That the   heirs of a married person "with pre-deceased iasue' are the widow,
                     widower, or the (surviving) children and that the heirs of a widower
                                                                          ;


                     or   widow   are the children             ;   that the heirs of an unmarried person are
                     brothers, cousins, nephews, or 'strangers in blood'                    ;   that the heir of a
                     husband or wife, predeceased without issue, is always the surviving wife
                     or husband    and that the heirs of the latter are brothers, lousins,
                                     ;


                     nephews, or 'strangers in blood'.

     Then, taking into account the experience in Italy from 1872 to 1905, as to tha
frequency  among deaths of unmarried as compared with miarried, and the experience
of Budapest and France as to the proportion of marriages dissolved without issue, and
assuming also the relation which the value of property left by the predeceased
husband or wife to the surviving partner bears to the value of the property that the
latter leaves to the children, assumed as 1 to 10, he deduces for the mean interval
between deaths of parents and the deaths of their children, i^, and the proper devolu-
tion interval, ii, a difference of 8 years, the latter being the smaller, i.e.                       :
                                                                                                         —
                im   ~    3^ years       ;   but     id   =   26 years only.


This does not p\irport to be an exact or definite relationship between the two methods
of estimating the devolution-interval, but is taken merely as shewing unquestionably
that " the devolution-interval                  is   appreciably smaller than the     mean interval between
the deaths of parents and the deaths of their children.                          Celibacy, the failure of issue
in   many marriages, and           inheritance between hiisbands and wives, which result in the
succession of persons of a                   more advanced         age, explain the difference      between these
two intervals."

        Gini points out that historical data afford evidence of the truth of this conclu-
sion, and that in every dynasty of sufficient duration it is found that the average
length of a reign is less than the average interval between the death of a king and

the death of an ascendant who preceded him.        He gives four examples, to which we
here add two others, viz., the experience in the Houses of Hapsburg and Hohen-
zollern.  It may be remarked that, since among monarchs bachelordom is quite
exceptional, the difference is due exclusively to the absence or predecease of sons.
In the table below the four first results are those given by Gini                       :
                                        —                                                                    —— —

    Gini argues that a better approximation of the values of i-m and id can be ob-
tained whenever figures are available shewing the degree of relationship of heirs to
whom portions of the properties are left, and he gives instances from Italian and
French      statistics.

     In     Ital-"     a distinction is made between 8 categories, viz.                                  :




          CiOupA.           {a) Ascendants and descendants (exclusive of adopted children);

                       (6) uncles and nephews    (c) great uncles and gi-eat nephews.
                                                                  ;



          Group B.           (d)   Husbands and wives                    ;
                                                                             (e)         brothers and sisters     ;   (/)   other relatives
                       up   to the sixth degree               ;   (3)   relativesbeyond the sixth degree, " strangers
                       in blood,"       and   institutions              other than benevolent or mutual aid.

     There        is   another category, viz., (h) benevolent and mutual aid institutions.                                                 On
distributing successions of very small                                  amounts             (less   than 100 francs) between               the

two groups, Gini obtained       for the five financial years 1903-4 to 1907-8, for property
left less    succession duties, the following result, expressed in francs                                             :




                 Group A, 3,434,301,000                     =     78.1%      ;           Group B, 961,855,000         =     21.9%.
For group A, the interval of devolution corresponds to the interval i^ between the
death of parents and the death of surviving children, there being compensating
features  and the interval of devolution for group B, denoted by k, by Gini, is much
             ;


shorter. He found the value for the former to be 34 years, and for the latter 17.
Hence the weighted mean is 30.28 years, i.e., 34 is multiplied by 0.781 plus 17 by
0.219.

    Gini classified " donations," which here would be known presumably as "settle-
ments," and for the combined figures in francs for the six financial years 1900-1 to
1905-6 he obtained                  :




                 Group A, 4,676,910,000                      =    80.4%          ;       Group B, 1,139,099,000             =     19.6%.
With the values 34 and                      17 as in the preceding case, these weights give 30.67 years,
Gini concluded that these two values, viz., 30.28 and 30.67, are probably somewhat
under the mark, and he supposed therefore that the true devolution interval                                                                 ia

about 31 years, betraying incidentally the imprecision of the result.
    In France there are no less than 14 categories, which can be grouped in a similar
manner, with the result that in groups A and B, the values in francs of the net pro,-
perty, viz., property              left, less          succession duties, are as follow                       :




                 Group A, 3,526,179,000                      =        77.5%          ;    Group B, 1,024,059,000             =    22.5%.
Weighting the               valvies 34  and 17 accordingly, he obtained 30.17 ye.ars as the true
devolution interval,               which does not differ very greatly from the preceding result.
His conclusion was that the hj^jothesis that the interval of devolution corresponds
to the interval between the death of parents and the death of children surviving
them, does not hold good in reality; in fact, that the interval of devolution ia shorter
by about three or four years {op. cit., p. 67).
     Gini recognises that for males and females, the interval of devolution is con-
spicuously different, the former generally leaving much larger properties than the
latter,while the mean duration of life of females is greater than that of males. He
then shews algebraically that, if the mean inierval between the deaths of parents and
children is calculated without taking these facts into account, the figure is too low
for computing private wealth     vide his work, pp. 67-68.
                                                       ;    He remarks that in Italy
the proportion of properties left by males <ompared with that left by females is
about 2 to 1, but in flermnn and Anglo-Saxon countries is much higher, being in
Victoria (1908) about 5 to                     1   ;       in Massachusetts (1898-91)                   about 3 to           1,   and   even

     It has also been recognised by him that it is necessary to take account of the
consequence of the ago of marriage in persons of various social classes ; richer males,
for example, marrying later than poor males ; and for this figures are given for Den-
mark by Rubin and Westergaard, for England by the Registrar-General (49th
Report), for the nobiUty of Sweden and Finland by Fahlbeck,for Italy in the Movi-
mento della popolazione secondo gli atti dello stato civile, 1896 and later, for Austria
in the population returns of 1895, and the following years. In regard to brides, there
appears to be no regularity, the age being almost the same for all social classes in
Denmark      ;   in      England brides         of the better classes are older                   ;    while in Sweden and
Finland brides of the nobility are younger than those of the population as a whole.
The general conclusion may be drawn, however, that the moan age of persons of
both sexes marrying is generally higher for the richer section of the population in the
countries referred to.   Consequently, if each case be weighted proportionately to
the value of the property, a higher figure would be obtained than that arrived at by a
simple arithmetic mean. In pointing this out Gini adds that, though the circum-
stances indicated have the effect of thus making the exact figure for the interval of
devolution greater, other circumstances have a contrary effect. He remarks that
rich persons have less children, and ordinarily these follow one another at longer
intervals.  He infers that on the whole it is probable that the interval
between marriage and the birth of the middle child is greater for the poor than for
the rich; vide p. 70. The influence of fecundity on the interval he points out can be
concluded from available data thus, in Paris, where the fecundity is low, it is 5
                                                  ;



years   in Xew South Wales, Australia, 7.6 years. Further, celibacy is more frequent
        ;


among the        rich       than among the poor, as                      also    is   childlessness of parents     hence      ;


collateral successions are              more frequent, the                effect being, as        he has shewn, that the
interval of devolution is sensibly shorter than for direct successions.



     Henry and Lavergne (see bibliography) point out another circumstance which has
the effect ofmaking the weighted mean of the intervals of devolution smaller than
the simple mean. They observe that it may be admitted that, in the average number
of cases    (i.e.,       in Continental Europe), the property of the married person dying                                            first

is   equal to the property of the surviving partner.                                  But a portion           of the property of
the partner dying             first   goes to the surviving partner.                      On     that account the second
inheritance which the children                    make from          their parents,       and which they will enjoy
for a shorter time, will              be greater than the            first      inheritance.  Using B to denote the
proportion of the property                 left   by the partner
                                               first dying to the surviving partner,

Gini derives the        the two formula* shewn below as a first approximation. But
                           first of

aince in Italy in recent years the proportion of married males to married females
dying was found to be aa 4 to 3, owing to the fact that husbands predecease their
wives more frequently than survive them,                            it   was necessary to take                this into account,
and also the fact that (at least in Italy) the property of the husband in relation to
that of the wife is about 2 to 1. Having regard to these circumstances Gini deduced
"the second formula    and taking the values for i^ = 34, k = 17, and g = Jj-, ob-
                               ;

similarly circumstanced.

76                      The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns.

     Other circumstances which exercise a different influence in different nations are
(a) the average age of persons marrying        (6) fecundity  (c) prevalence of celibacy
                                                              ;                       ;


(d) the infertility of marriages ; (e) the relative frequency of succession by husbands
and wives, and by collateral relations. Gini remarks that in Italy these circumstances
caused variations even from province to province.        He adds that " on the other hand
no influence is exercised on the calculation of the interval of devolution by the fact

that the testators leave larger amounts of property when they are more advanced in
age," and he mentions that Mallet and Beneduce regard this fact as important.
It may be remarked, en passant, that this can hardly be correct, and wiU bo referred
to later.  According to Gini it is not a question of the mean age of testators, but
only of the interval between their death and that of their heirs. These are reasons
for the statement that the interval between the death of a testator and that of his
heir is different when the testator is older and therefore, on the average, richer, than
when he       is       younger, and consequently on the average poorer.                                  But the    interval

is   greater in the second case      and not in the first.

     If a testator has more than average time to augment his hereditary property,
this augmentation may be due to two causes, either (n) because he dies at a greater
age than the average, and then it has to be assumed that his heir will have less than
the average time to augment the inheritance left to him     or (h) because the person     ;



from whom the testator himself inherited died younger than at the average age, in
which case the capital he inherited must have been less than the average. It there-
fore seems clear, he adds, that            —
                                 if the interval of devolution be not on the average

different for categories of the population               more or                less rich     —the fact that       testators
dying at an advanced age                  leave    more property                in individual cases          can have no
influence.            As previously indicated, the validity                 of this       view   is   questionable, and to
this point        we      shall return.

       Gini's     summing up        in regard to    methods              of evaluating the devolution-interval            is

as foUowB         :




          (i.)    The various methods used           for calculating the interval                     between the birth   of
                       parents and the births of children give different results, which are                               al-

                       ways approximate, but may be                  either in excess or in defect.

         (ii.)    The taking of the mean interval between the birth of parents and the                                births
                       of children as equivalent to the interval of devolution                            is   based on sup-
                       positions which are not supported                   by   facts.

         (iii.)       It is necessary, first of   all,   to       make
                                                                  a simple arithmetic mean,
                                                                          use, not of
                       but of a weighted arithmetic mean, which takes cognisance of the fact
                       that the interval of devolution              is   different for categories of persons with
                       more    or with less property.

         (iv.)        Regard must be had to the fact that the interval between the birth of
                       parents and the births of children does not, on account of many cir-
                       cumstances, correspond to the interval between the death of parents
                       and the death of their surviving children.
          (v.) It         would certainly be      desirable, but is not generally possible, to take                       all

                        these circumstances into account.                    But   it is      possible   and necessary     to
                        have regard to one most important circumstance, viz., that the interval
                        between the death of parents and the death of their children is appreciably
                        longer than the interval between the death of testators and the death of
                        their heirs. This circumstance is due to the fact that the interval in
                        the case of successions by strangers in blood, by collateral relatives,
                        and by husbands or wives, is shorter than in the case of direct succession..
                                                                                                —

       (vi.) It   should therefore be remembered that            if   this circumstance  is not taken

               into account, the calculated interval of devolution                about 3 or 4 years
                                                                                 is

               too high.   The figures for the interval of             devolution, jiow put at about
               33 to 34 years, should, therefore, be lowered to, say, 29 to 31 years (op.
               cit, pp. 72-73).

     Illustrating by a detailed example for Italy in 1905, Gini calculates the mean age
of bridegrooms at 29.10, and of brides at 25.13 years, and gives the following
results for the years 1902-1906, which shew a small but definite change                     :




                                           1902.       1903.     1904.        1905.        1906.


      Bridegrooms                          29.29       29.27     29.25        29.10        29.07 years
      Brides                               25.22       25.21     25.18        25.13        25.07
      Differences                          4.07         4.06          4.07      3.97        4.00



     By weighting the corresponding figures for Italian provinces (1905) by the ratio
of the inheritances in every province to the inheritances in the whole kingdom, he
obtains the result for bridegrooms =29.07, and for brides =24.91 years.     All these
figures are    approximately 29 and 25 years.

      In Italy the     mean      interval between the date of marriage and the             mean date     of

birth of all children can be taken as about 8 years.                  The mean age      of fathers at the
mean date of the births  of their children in Italy is probably not far from 34 years, and
 ofmothers from 30 years. These figures agree fairly with those found by Baseri for
Udine, viz., fathers = 34, and mothers = 30.5, and for Rome, viz., fathers = 36.5, and
mothers = 29.6. Basing his conclusion on these various sets of figures, Gini takes
the mean interval between the birth of fathers and children as 35 years, and between
the birth of mothers and children as 31 years.      Owing to the increase in the duration
of adult Ufe, however (presumably for 1882 to 1901 ; vide op. cit., p. 76) he cal-
culates from this the interval between the death of parents and children for fathers
= 36.17 years, and for mothers =32.17 years. These intervals, he thinks, correspond
 to the devolution-interval in          78-80%     of all cases of inheritance, while in the balance
 of cases it is   not more than 17 years.Taking 80%, this gives the devolution-interval
 from fathers to sons =32.34 years, and from mothers to daughters = 29.14 years.
 For adult ages, the difference in the duration of life for males and females is about
 6 months.    Assuming, it would seem somewhat at hazard, that property inherited
 by males is to property inherited by females aa 3 to 2, and that property left by males
 is to property left by females as 2 to 1, he deduces the devolution
                                                                     -interval id for Italy

 as 31.8 years and by a similar calculation, that for France as 29.4 years. Mallet, he
                   ;


 points out, and as mentioned before herein, endeavoured to determine the devolution-
 interval by means of the figures shewing the expectation of life of heirs from 272
 cases in which all particulars were known and used the English Life Tables, 1891-
                                                        ;

 of the expectation  of life i'm, = 24, and the weighted mean (that is, weighted by the
 aggregate amount or product of the numbers and amount per individual) i ^
 = 26.9 years.
      Arguing from the peculiarities in Enghsh inheritances (more frequent trans-
 mission of real than of personal property to lineal descendants, no transmissions of
 real property to widows, etc.), MaUet thought the devolution-interval should
                                                                              be taken

that 272 caaeg are too limited a basis ; fiirther, that the mean expectation of hfe may
possibly be greater for those possessing property than for others       and agam, that
                                                                                   ;



amongst those possessing property it possibly increases with the amount of property.
If this were so, Life Tables would be required giving the expectation of life at single
ages for possessors of property only, and the figures would have to be weighted
according to the amount of property this cannot at present be done.
                                                :




     Harper proposed to use the British Insurance Offices' Life Table O*"^, and by
that means found j'^ = 27.4 years. This appears to Gini to be too low, partly
because the greater expectation of hfe of females is disregarded, and partly because
the mean expectation of life of heirs was not weighted in proportion to the property
inherited.

     Gini himself proposes the use of the difference between the mean age of testators
and the mean age of heirs, and to weight the ages proportionately to the property
involved, and he arrives at the following conclusions               :




     " The devolution-interval is given by the difference between the weighted mean
age at which persons inherit, and the weighted mean age at which they transmit the
inherited property   where the ages of the various persona are weighted proportion-
                        ;


ately to the amount of the inheritance."    As, however, it is not possible to follow
up individual persons from the moment when they inherit to the moment when                              they,
in their turn, transmit their inheritance, this has to be modified as follows                   :




     "    The devolution-interval can be determined,  as a first approximation, by means
of the difference     between the weighted average age of heirs and the weighted average
age of testators of the same year."

     This, denoted       by     be the exact devolution-interval only if the mean
                                i'd,    will
duration of    life            remain constant. Since, however, this continues to
                      of proprietors
increase, a second approximation should be made, when the weighted ages of both
testators and heirs have been determined for a long series of years, together with the
respective values of        i'g,.   Then we     are able to state that " the devolution-interval
can be determined from the difference between the weighted average age of the
testators of a given year and the weighted average age of heirs at id years before."

    Mallet's calculations, he asserts, furnish the data for this.    They give the
simple and weighted averages of ages of heirs = 45.2 and 41.0 years respectively.
From the same figures Gini computes the ages of testators for the two years 1905 and
1906, and found the simple and weighted averages of ages of testators                       =       64.4 and
69.7 years respectively.               This gives the   mean    devolution-inter\-al   =   69.7     — 41 =
28.7 years.

     Gini maintains, however, that this is too small, because the mean dm'ation of
life ofproprietors increases with the time.  On the other hand it must not be for-
gotten that the average age of heirs was calculated on a very small number, and that
the average age of testators refers to possessors of at least £100.

     For Victoria, Australia, in 1908, the simple and weighted averages of the ages                        of
testators was found by Gini to bo respecti\ely              :

    For France, in 1906, the simple average age of testators was 61 years 7 months.
The use made    o£ this figure in subsequent calculations (by which March found the
devolution -interval = 29 years 5 months^ is pointed out by Gini to have been based
upon several erroneous assumptions, viz., that the heirs were supposed to be dis-
tributed in ages as the people living, and that the sinlple mean was satisfactory.
March, having found the mean age of the living at the 1901 Census to be 31 years 2
months, deducted it from the simple mean of the ages of the testators (jl years 7
months, the difference 29 years 5 months being assumed to represent the mean
devolution-interval. The computation Gini points out is, however, unsatisfactory,
because on the one hand the heirs are distributed in respect of age quite differently to
the living, and on the other hand because the calculation of the average age from the
simple instead of the weighted mean leads to sensible error. It is, however, to March
that credit is due for having first thought of deriving tlie devolution-interval from
the difference between the mean age of testators and the mean age of heirs.

     In closing this apergu of Professor Gini's criticism of the devolution-interval
method, it may be remarked that he recognises the grave limitations to which it is
subject, and on this matter we shall offer later some further observations.      It is
quite clear that the devolution-interval is different as between country and country,
and the data necessary for its proper computation are at least as elaborate as the
data necessary for computing by another and more direct method. Before proceeding
with tt discussion of this, it will not be inappropriate to give Gini's general con-
clusions in respect of various methods of computing private wealth.      These are as
follow   :




         (a)           All methods have both advantages and disadvantages.
         (b)           It    is impossible to assert that one is theoretically superior to another ;

                            but it must, on the contrary, be held that according to the statistical
                            data available for a country, so is one or the other method the better.
             (c)       Though the method of the devolution-interval seemed, for a long time,
                        to ba the safest, new elements of uncertainty are continually being
                            discovered in   it   ;   its   application in Italy was, however, justified in the
                            past,   inasmuch as the necessary data for the other methods were lacking.
             (d)       The method        of the capitalisation of incomes may perhaps give fair results
                            for the   United Kingdom, but cannot be based on any secure foundation
                            in other countries.
             (e)       In Sweden, Hungary and France the Inventory-method                     may perhaps lead
                         to the best results.

             (/)       A    plausible application of     any other method to all forms of wealth can
                            hardly be conceived.      But that does not imply that in the valuation of
                            the different   categories of wealth it is necessary always to use the same
                            method.  [The author appears to ignore the essential conceptual
                                    between the rate-of -devolution method and the interval-of-
                            difference
                         devolution method.]
             {g)       Further, if in the case of any country, one method appears preferable to
                            the others, the latter         may still   offer useful elements for the purposes of
                            independent estimate or checking.
             {h    )   There are methods, such as that                 of the proportion   between existing and
                            hereditary property, which, although they may not lead to a satisfactory
                            evaluation of the wealth of any given country, may serve in a comparison
                            of the wealth of different countries, so far as the uncertainty and thn

            (i.)   Finally, it appears that hitherto the statisticians       have been often too
                     exclusive in the choice of their methods,      and consequently the maxim to
                     be observed by anyone        who   undertakes the calculation of wealth is      :




                     "    The   best   method   consists  in taking advantage of     all methods"

         The defect oi the devolution-interval method. The preceding discussion by
Gini of the devolution-interval method exposes the complexity of its assumptions,
and reveals something of its inherent uncertainty. The fact that it depends upon so
many changing factors, the precise estimation of which is not unattended with
difficulty,                                     which moreover are uncertain, and the
                   and the appropriate corrections         for
further fact that its pitfalls are not obvious, indicate that  it should be abandoned

if any method, the intrinsic character of which is more obvious, can be employed.

It will be seen later that there are elements also which it does not embrace.

       Professor Gini's very able discussion of the proper computation of the devolu-
tion-interval shews conclusively that factors    must be applied which take account,
not only of the magnitude of successions and of settlements, but also of sex                     differ-

ences in regard thereto, and of the variation of these with time.

       Let us       fix   our attention upon the question of the devolution-interval inregard
to the persona (with the requisite wealth) living at say the present moment.                        An
infinitesimal group at age x will liveon the average say e^ years, e j. being the expecta-
tion of life for the age x    in other words, this period will be the crude devolution-
                                       ;


interval for all persons of age x.  We will, however, be in error if we assume that the
(l/e3;)th part will pass in one year.     In order to find the true amount it will be
necessary to take into account the manner in which e^. is ascertained, because the
number of persons of any age x does not decrease with the lapse of time in a linear
manner. When account is taken of the non-linear character of the decrease it is
immediately evident that we are concerned, not with the expectation of life or devolution-
interval, but with the devolution-rate or instantaneous rate of mortality           ;   and the average
of this taken over one year will be the rate of mortality for the middle of the year.
It   is,   of course, true that there are analytical relations
                                                       between the '" expectation of
life" atvarious ages and the rate of mortality at various ages, but if we posses the
latter we need not concern ourselves in regard to the former in order to ascertain
with what rapidity the wealth of the community will pass to successors. In fact,
the necessity of ascertaining the devolution-interval was for no other purpose than
this.  From this point of view it is at once seen that the attempt to introduce the general
devolution-interval into the question is            a   useless complication,   not merely because       it
needs so           many
                   correcting modifications, but also because the fundamental idea that
this interval is required, or is the appropriate quantity to use, 19 really invalid. In short,
the crude basis of the idea, viz., that if the existing wealth in any generation passes
in the interval i to another generation, the ith part passes in one year is not correct.
The rapidity of passing is measured by the death-rate itself, and in order to measure
the rate of devolution of estates it merely requires that the frequency of deaths in
                                —
various age-groups and, since the amount per indi\-idual passing at death varies
with age, the relative importance of each age-group in respect of wealth should                —
 be known.

     Thus tho idea of the " devolution-interval" should be abandoned and in its
 place the idea of the " rate of devolution," should bo adopted, computing this
 latter by means of the death-rates at different ages, weighted according to
                                                                             the average
 amount of wealth possessed at these agefi. For this purpose only atatistios of the rate
 of mortality for different ages and of the ages of persons dying and of
                                                                             the size of

their estates   is   needed.         be seen that the mere statement of this method
                                    It will
indicates at once its superiority over the      method of ascertaining the devolution-
interval. In principle it is direct and, so far as it goes, exact. Unfortimately, however,
the conception put forward, though lacking nothing in accuracy as regards principle,
is inadequate in regard to the proper definition of all the relevant circumstances.

This will appear as we proceed, and we shall endeavour to exhibit its limitations
as well as to  illustrate its technique. We shall call the method which we now
proceed to examine the " Devolution-Rate Method" in contra-distincticn to the
" Devolution -Interval Method." To what has been said, it may be added that the
rate-of -devolution method might quite appropriately be called the rigorous "parcel
method," because the fundamental conception is that the incidence of death is
indiscriminate, and therefore those dying in each age-group are, with some
limitations, a representative sample of the entire group.




                     CHAPTER         11.— THE     RATE OF DEVOLUTION.


     1.                                        —
        The devolution-rate method. In his contribution tc the discussion of Messrs.
Harris and Lake's paper on " Estimates of the Realisable Wealth of the United
Kingdom based mostly on the Estate Duty Returns," Sir T. A. (then Mr.) Coghlan
                                                                        '


made an important suggestion that the " only true way of ascertaining the wealth of
those alive from the amount of those who had died during a given period, was to
take into consideration the ages of persons both living and dying" (p. 736). He
advised the formation of age-groups, the finding of " the average wealth possessed
by the persons in each category" (i.e., age-group), and then bj' " multiplying the
amount so ascertained by the numbers then living belonging to each category"
(group), " they would arrive at the total wealth of the community" (ibid).     This
suggestion was applied by Mr. Bernard Mallet in his paper of 18th February, 1908
(Joum. Roy. Stat. Soc, Ixxi., pp. 65-84, 1908), and he deduced values for England
for 1905 and 1906 by this method (loc. cit., p. 74). The statement of the method as
it appears above needs some qualification, which will be discussed in due course.


    The principle of the devolution -rate method more                   rigorously stated   is   as follows   :




        (i.)   Assuming that   at each age those dying fairlj' represent, in respect of
               wealth possessed, the living at the same age, the ratio at that age of
               the living to the dying is the factor to be multiplied into the aggregate
               wealth possessed by the dying in order to express the wealth of the
               living.

       (ii.)   Since experience has shewn that the mortality-rate at any age differs
                as between males and females, and that the average wealth possessed
               also differs, the wealth possessed             by the        sexes should be estimated
               separately in order to secure precision in the results.

           (iii.)     If the incidence of      death varies as between different classes

                      dying at that age must be evalued and allowed
                       correct results.

already been said to indicate
being founded upon the devolution-rate.       In formulating the statement of its
                                           " parcel-method" will be kept mainly in
technique the notion of the method a9 a
view, though wo shall use either conception indifferently, since they
                                                                      both are appro-

the significance of the facts from the one or from the other point of
matter,  however,   will appear  more  definite if it be borne in mind  that, subject to

certain limitations, the dying are to be taken as a sample of the living in
                                                                            regard to the

however, are important, for it wiU be found that there are reasons for believing
                                                                                       to
the living must be regarded as in some respects differently characterised in regard
wealth from the dying    and it is also to be borne in mind that the rigour of the
                                       ;


" parcel" assumption increases as the age-group diminishes, since the death-rate

varies conspicuously from age to age.    We proceed to consider the technique of
the method.

     Probate returns reveal the fact that D persons dying in any age-group were, in
the aggregate, possessed of the amount of wealth w, say. If they be regarded as a
fair sample of the group, then the aggregate of wealth, W, in the same age-group,
will be the ratio of the living to the dying (L/D                              =
                                                   R say) multiplied into the wealth
 possessed          by the     D   persons,    i.e.   :
                                                          —
                 (3)               W= wL/D = wE =                     w/r.


 in   which      r,    the reciprocal of B,           is   the death-rate.

      It has been suggested, however, that the general rate of mortality of the age-
 group does not accurately represent the class whose wealth comes under review in
 probate returns, forasmiich as it has been supposed that the death-rate for that class
 will be less, for example, than that for all classes combined.       Thus ]Mr. A. M.
 Laughton, the Government Statist of the State of Victoria, expresses the opinion that
 " it is probable that the rate of mortality among persons having property is below
 that prevailing in the general community      and that it will approximate to the rate
                                                                  ;



 among assured lives." ' It may be added that probably each country has its special
 characteristics as regards this.   If the view expressed be just, then the multipUer

  R will not be strictly correct. This is a point which must hereinafter necessarily
 be fully considered.

    ;i.   The     error ol treating the entire population as a single age-group.           —The      most
elementary application of the preceding formula would be to treat the entire popula-
tion as forming a single age-group, that is, to assume that the living and dying are
similarly constituted as regards wealth.      In this case the aggregate of wealth, W,
of the community, or at least that part of it tohich would pay probate, is             :




          (4)-          W    = Pw/D =          w/r    = Rw;

the heavy letters having the same meaning as indicated above,                      viz.,   in   §   2,   but
a.pplying to the entire probate-paying group.

    We                           assumption leads to a result very much in excess of
          shall see later that this
the truth,   applied to the entire population. For in the State of Victoria for the
             if

years 1908 to 1912 inclusive, we obtain the following results, I. to IV., according as
they are calculated for males and females together or separately.

            be seen from these results that, when males and females are treated
       It will
separately, thesum of the two is uniformly less (on the average about 5i per cent.)
than when the population is treated without distinction of sex. This is due to the
great disparity between the amounts contributed by females and males.             From
what is shewn later it will be seen further that correction factors are necessary these             ;

                      can be treated as a single group as has often been done it will also

be observed that these correcting factors are different from year to year.            The
correction-factor for "persons," for the average of the 1908-1912 results, is 0.3822.

      Here it may be obs erved that any population consists roughly of equal numbers of
the sexes, but the data shew that not only have females on the average much less
wealth than males, but also there are fewer possessing wealth               hence result ;



(1), see table, based on the number of persons, will in general be of less accuracj' than
that based upon a consideration of the data for the sexes treated separately. An
analogous observation applies to the age-groups among either sex. It is due to this
latter that the large correction factor is required,        and to   this   we   shall   now     refer.


       The   correction-factor for the average of the 1908-1912 results for " males " is
no   less   than 0.3908  ; and the correction-factor for " females," on the same basis,
no   less   than 0.4471.       (The   way   in   which these correction-factors are deduced                 ia

explained hereinafter.) It is fairly evident from these examples that the method,
even with the use of the deduced correction-factors, cannot be expected to yield
results of high accuracy, since the correction-factors vary greatly from year to year.


     Assuming that the persons of each age dying are characterised, in respect of
wealth possessed, similarly to those living of the same age, then it follows that for the
dying to correctly represent the living, it is essential either that the numbers dying in
each age-group must be proportional to the numbers living in the same groups that                       ;


is to say, the death-rate must be the same for all ages, or that by some complex

relation the wealth-ratio will be fortuitously identical.        The latter supposition is
obviously excluded as a general possibility and above 5 years of age the death-rate
                                                      ;


is small where the numbers of the population are relatively large, and large (for the

older ages) where the numbers of the population are relatively small.              Hence,
a priori, it is obvious that the whole range of life cannot be treated as a single age-
group. To do so cannot yield an accurate result, or one even approximately correct.
We have already seen that it does not do so, for the correcting factor, instead of
being nearly unity, was only about 0.4.




     4.   The error oJ estimations of wealth by attributing it to a single age-group of
                             —
21 years and upward. The characteristic defect in the assumption that the popula-
tion may be treated as a single age-group will apply to any large age-group, but will
be less serious if we exclude the ages, viz., the earlier ages of life, which, while they
contribute      little   or nothing to the probate-returns, exhibit considerable fluctuations
in their death-rates.


       It has
            sometimes been assumed, in estimating wealth from probate-returns,
that    would be sufficiently accurate to regard adult lives aa constituting a homo-
       it

geneous group, and consequently that it would be satisfactory to suppose that the
whole of the wealth disclosed in such returns could be di\'ided by the total number of
adults dying in order to obtain the average per individual.    This, it was thought,
could be regarded as the average wealth per head of all adults   hence, by multiply.
                                                                             ;

ing this average    by the   total   number   of adults living, the aggregate private wealth
would be ascertained, subject        of course to   some   correction for the fact that there   is   no
necessity to   make probate returns for less than a certain amount.           This very erroneotts
method has even been used in     official statistics.


    The method approximates, however, somewhat more closely to the truth than
the previous assumption under which the entire population was treated as a single
age-group, and was used in Victoria for estimating the average net value of estates for
1898-1902.   The amount per head of deceased adults was computed, and this
amount, multiplied by the number of adults at the middle of the period (or rather
those disclosed at the Census of 1901) was regarded as indicating the total private
wealth.   It will be seen later that the error of this assumption is considerable, and
that the   method should not be         followed.    As already indicated,     it   virtually treats
the entire population     both sexes) of 21 years of age and upward as a homogeneous
                         (of
age-group, and attributes the net wealth disclosed in the probate returns to the
adults dying.   It therefore supposes that they may be taken to fairly represent the
adults living, and that no serious error will be made in supposing that the whole
wealth of the community belongs to the adults.

     In this method the value of R in formula (4) will be the reciprocal of the death-
rate for all agesfrom the beginning of 21 upwards, and the magnitude of its errors is
fully iBustrated in the tables hereunder, that is to say, the result so deduced must be
multiplied by the correcting factor indicated in the table to give the proper result.
This factor would be, of course, unity if the method were correct, consequently its
reciprocal shews the magnitude of the error arising from neglectint; it.

         Let this factor be denoted by k'                               ;   then obviously, by mere definition                           :

the total wealth, the suffixes denoting here the successive age-groups. But since it.
isassumed that the distribution of wealth among the living is the same as among the
dying, it follows that, for each age-group,                                     W
                                               = Pio/D = Rw that ie, the recipro-                                     ;


cal of the death-rate for the age-group multiplied by the wealth revealed in the
probates for the group. Hence, substituting this for W, and dividing both sides of
the equation by w,                         +       w,    +    etc.    =     Hw, we obtain

                (6)                   k'    =      T,(R .wfLw);

each suffix for R being the same as that for the corresponding w throughout. That
is to say k' is the weighted value of the R's, the weights being the relative dis-

tribution according to age of the wealth disclosed by probate.

         From         the last formula                      it is   at once evident that the factor h' depends merely
upon the product                      of the relative distribution of wealth according to age into the
reciprocal of the death-rave according to age                                       ;    that   is, it is       affected  by changes both
in the distribution of                             wealth according to age, and                     in the           mortaUty according to
age.

         The    result is important, for it exposes definitely the invalidity of the attempts to
deduce this factor merely from the duration of a generation, from the general death-
rate, or the expectation of life at age 0, or by any similar process in short, it shews                                      ;


that "what            is       known       as the devolution-interval                     method, which "we have already con-
sidered at length,                   is   an invaUd method.

         There        is,                   no necessary relation between the factor
                                of course, as already implied,
k' and the general death-rate for either sex (or for " persons") of the ages during
which it is found through probate that wealth appears in evidence (or if we pleeise,.
the death-rate for all ages), a point to which reference will be made later. Let,
however, a be a factor which, multiplied into R^ the reciprocal of this death-rate,*

 By      applying this formula                          it   can be discovered whether a                    '   is   fairly constant.            More
 accurate results will, of course, be obtained if the factor be deduced for the sexes
 separately, the method becoming quite rigorous when the age-groups are infinitesimal.

     From what has preceded it is clear that it is impossible to deduce the factor
which must be multiplied into the wealth appearing in probate returns, \mless at
least two things are known, viz.,

            (a)       the relative amount of wealth contributed by people in the different
                        age -groups  and           ;

it is, of course, necessary to have the absolute death-rates    but if we assume that                  ;




the death-rates in each age-group vary as the general death-rate, then their
mutual                  is sufficient, taken in conjunction with that general
                 relation                                                     death-rate. It

will be          most convenient to work with reciprocals \/r^ etc., of the death-rates, say
iJj, iJj,,              the relation of these to the reciprocal of the death-rate for
                     etc., or to find

the aggregate of   groups concerned, iJ„ say. That is, if the values oi p^=RJR„,
                              all                                       ,




p„    =
     RJR„, etc., be found, it might bo expected that they probably will not
change greatly lor moderate intervals of time, and, given these for any epoch,
the group-rates can be approximately determined therefrom by multiplying by the
general death-rate or death-rate of the aggregate.                                          Hence from         (6), (7)   and   (8)   we
have       :



                     (9)            k'    =    i?„   2   (pw))   / Sm),                          and

                     (10)            a'    =    '^(pw) /S«j;

or,   if    u be written            for   w/Hw, then         this last expression takes the                   form

                     (11)            a'   =    p^u^      +   p^u^   +       etc   =   S   [pu)

which           is   independent of the ahsolute values both of the death-rate and the wealth at each
age.        Then        it would follow that



                     (12)            W     =    a'iJ„2w           =     k"Sw

that is to say, the aggregate wealth of the living (whose estates would be subject to
probate) is the product of the wealth actually appearing in probate returns, multi-
plied by the product of the factor a' into the reciprocal of the general death-rate
(or the death-rate of a large                        group       of ages, e.g. 15 to 85).



                                                                                  —
        Should the general death-rate be used ? Before furnishing mmierical results

for comparisons, the questions  may be considered whether R^ may be taken as the
general death-rate, or whether it should be the death-rate for the ages within the
limits for which probate returns appear.   These may be taken as from say 10 or 15
years of age upwards.                          The death-rate               for the ages         to 9      and that   for the   whole
of    life      in the State of Victoria are respectively                         :

       To compute a value
                        of the factor a' or of the factor k', to be applied to " per-
sons,"     obvious that in the former case we must take account of differences
           it   is

in the wealth contributed, and in the latter the differences both in wealth and
death-rates.            To compute        this for persons, let          a '^ denote the       factor for males,        a '/
for females,         and   a'j, for   persons     ;    St«,,„, 'Zwj,   and   T,t"p   the aggregate wealth, subject
to probate, for males, females,               and persons respectively and Rm, Rf, and ;                       Rj, the
reciprocals of the death-rates for males, females,                and persons respectively                     ;       then
obviously the weighted result                is    :




                (13).        a'p      =   {a'm^m'^^m             +     a'fRfI.Uf)/Rj,'Lwj,

                (14).         .k'p    =   (Aj'^Sm)^         +   k'fSiVf)     / Hu

and these formulae                   though only approximate, probably be sufficiently
                             will, of course,
accurate for practical purposes.     For strictly accurate results the values of a and                             '


k' for "    persons" should be determined directly, in the same manner as for males or
for females.


    8.  Estimation of the uncertainty in the values oJ the correction-factors.^ It is                          —
obvious from what has preceded that the results deduced from single years must be
subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty.                             The     irregularity of the appearance
of large estates in the returns necessarily involves this,                                 and the fact is perhaps
more   strikingly seen in the values deduced for the coefficients a'                              and k' which, it
will later      be shewn, are      sufficiently accurate for the              purpose in quastion      :

       There    no doubt, much larger " systematic " errors than these, viz., errors
                  are,
due    to the tendency to make the element of estimate of value a " conservative
one," but such errors carmot be readily determined, and their estimation is not a
question of mathematical technique. Quite apart from this the wealth deduced from
the aggregate coming under review in probate in any one year is probably in error not
lesn than 7%, even if the death-rate be taken into account, and not less than 9"„ if
it   be neglected       ;    and further, the mean of                      five years' results reduces these                     amounts
respectively only to about                  Group-values for 10 years would pro-
                                         3% and 4%.
bably be only 2% in error in either case, and the deduced result could be regarded
as applying to the middle of the period.

          Cause oi uncertainty in results. In order to see whether deductions of wealth
from probate returns are entitled to much confidence, the effect both of the absolute
amounts of the wealth in the returns, and the absolute values of the death-rates
should be eliminated. To do this it will suffice to compute a table of values of u,
viz., of the ratios of the wealth passing at any age to the total wealth passing, and

also one of values of pu, for a series of j'ears, for which purpose the Victorian data for
the yeara 1908-1912 are taken (see tables hereunder). Variation in the values of
u is, of course, caused by the irregular appearance of large estates among probate-
returns.

     Even for a considerable population, the frequency with which very large estates
appear in such returns will be irregular compared with that with which smaller
«states appear.   This is conspicuously shewn in any returns of the number of estates
of different magnitude.    We take an illustration from Prussian returns, the reason
for obtaining which has now become manifest                                         :




                                     Prussian Estates of Various Sizes, 1911.

It is at once obvious from this table that the falling in of very large estates through
death will be rare    nevertheless, when it does occur, it will greatly prejudice the

evaluation of the factors a and k for the year in question, since the ratio of u = »• /1,w
for some particular age-group will be greatly altered.      Obviously we are not con-
cerned with changes in the absolute amounts, but only in their ratio to the total, and
this   is   what   is       shewn   in the tables hereinafter.                      Similar remarks apply to variations
of death-rate,          but there        is   no reason       to believe that these fluctuate greatly.

     In the following taljle any effect due merely to variations in the absolute amount
of wealth  is eliminated as explained.    The ratio of the wealth of each group to the
total is expressed from year to year in the upper part of the table.   In the lower part
of the tableis given the product of this ratio, into the ratio which the reciprocal of the

death-rate of this group bears to the reciprocal of the general death-rate                                                   :

indicated.

preferably, it is thought, ten, since that is long enough to include the
periods of financial vicissitudes. ^ It has already been mentioned that
                                                                             Gini had

noticed the effect of change in the                mean duration       of   life    upon the devolution-
interval.       A like remark       applies also to the factor R,      which       is   to be multiplied into

the wealth contributed by each age-group of deceased persons. A careful examma-
tion of the evidence in the last three tables will shew an indication of progressive
change with time. If the death-rate diminish, the factor R will increase. And here
it may be stated that Australian mortality experience (1881-1890 and
                                                                          1901-1910)

shews the necessity          of recognising that     no factor can be regarded as of constant value.
We now        pass to the consideration of this point.


    10. Effect of change in the rate of mortality ^ upon the computation of private
wealth.—The change of the death-rate for almost every age-group in Australia is
remarkable.          This   is   seen in the following table   :

      The   values of         R   are based   upon the   Life Tables prepared   in   connection
with the     1911 AustraHan          Census, and shew      how very   different these    values
may  be for different States, those for Queensland being given by way of com-
parison with the values for the Commonwealth. They also show that the factors
by which the amounts revealed in probate must be multiplied vary very markedly
with time.
      The   results     for    the past 30 years   may    be very fairly represented    by an
equation of the form

effect of the variation in the death-rate         can be made arithmetically apparent by

       12.   Correction to reduce group-iesults to results given by a continuous curve.
We have seen that if the whole population be treated       as a single age-group, the error
is               we get the correct result only after multiplying by about "4. If we
     so great that
treat the whole of the wealth as belonging to persons of 21 years of age and upwards,
which is substantially true, the factor of correction becomes about 0'.5, that is, it ia
slightly nearer unity.   It is, of course, also true that even a ten-year group will not
give a theoretically faultless result, since the smaller the group the more accurately
will the facts be represented, inasmuch as, in their ideal form, the curves of variation
of wealth with age, and of death with age, must be regarded as continuous.        In the
nature of the case, group-methods are, of course, only approximate, and before
adopting them it is necessary to inquire whether the error, consequent upon the
adoption of a group of any particular size, is negligible or not. It has already been
shewn that the error of ten-year groupings is very small in comparison with the
uncertainty of the data, and it maybe added that five-year age-groupings might well
be regarded as rigorously exact.        We shall consider first the question              of the error of
ten-year age-groupings, and shall deduce a factor of correction which will probably
be sufficiently exact for ten-year groupings in other countries.

       The   rigorous solution can be developed in the following form.                 Put


             (19)        p   = R/Ro =   /, (x)   ;   u8x    = 8W/W =          /, (x)   8x

Jf^ {x) dx thus being unity between the limits of age comprised, say, 10 to 105, or
 if we prefer it from age to the end of life. Then


             (20)        8W = R8W =       RWf^       (x)   8x   =   R„ Wf,   (x) f, (x)   8x   ;




consequently


             (21)        W   = RoW / pudx
the limits being the extreme ages in question.


     By graduation of the curves p and « for yearly values it was found that for
" males," " females," and " persons" this last expression gave correcting factors
of about 0.9873, 0.9817, and 0.9858 respectively, instead of unity, to be applied to the
group-results adopted (viz., about 10 years) to reduce them to what would be given
by 1-year groups, and further, a factor of about 0.9997 to reduce them to what would
be given by infinitesimal groups, i.e., by 0.9870, 0.9814, and 0.9855 respectively. That
is, the group-results for ''persons" should be multiplied by 0.9858 x 0.9997 = 0.9855,

and similarly for males and females. That is, the group-results for " persons"
require to be multiplied by say 0.986.    If, however, only 1.4% be allowed to partially

(or wholly ?) compensate for a defect due to the wealthier classes possibly living as                  —
                        —
has been supposed somewhat longer than the average, then no correction need be
applied, and the group-result may be regarded as correct.     It will, however, be

decidedly preferable to retain the reduction and consider the other question inde-
pendently.

    Five-year groupings would require reduction by factors 0.9967, 0.9954 and
0.9963 for" males,"" females," and" persons" respectively to reduce to infinitesimal
groupings.

       We now       consider the question of the possible magnitude of a correction for
variations in the death-rate with wealth.

group.— If in any age-group  it should happen  that the death-rates have any  ayate-

matic relationship to the wealth of the cla'^aes within the group, then the assumption
that the dying represent the living is not quite correct. This question
                                                                                  may be
presented in several ways. First, let us suppose that the people of any limited
                                                                                     age-

                            according to wealth   possessed, have   characteristic death-
group, divided into claaaes
rates according to class. Then the aggregate of wealth        of the entire group would             W
be made up of the wealth W, W", etc., of the classes. And, similarly, the aggregate
                                                                 «>'", etc., the amounts
of the wealth {w) of the dying would be made up of w ',«)",
accruing by the deaths in the several classes.                                     Then obviously we have              :




             (22)            W=         W + W" +                    etc.   =   E'w'        +   B"w"     +   etc.   = XRw

where    E  the reciprocal of the death-rate for the whole, and R', B", etc., are the
                  is

reciprocals of the death-rates of the several classes.   Thus it is also immediately
evident, on dividing both sides of the preceding equation by Rw, that

                                                     R'        w'         R" w"
                               A=                -—                  h
                                                                         --•           h etc.
                  (23)
                                                     R         w           R   w
that   is,    A    is the   sum    of the prodiicts of the relative death-rate of the class (aa compared
with that of the age-group aa a whole) into the                   relative wealth of the class, that is its

ratio to the wealth of the whole group.

       Or again, writing Rg                          for   XR, we have          for    Ro, the proper reciprocal to use as
multiplier, the weighted                 mean              of the reciprocals of the death-rates, viz.                      :




                                                                         w /
                                                                                       „       w"

                                                                         w                     w
     This formula indicates that the process is exactly analogous to that of forming
groups according to age, and it may be also observed that the remarks regarding the
adoption of a continuous method also apply in their due measure. There would,
however, not be the same necessity to form small groups, since the distribution of
death-rate according to wealth will not, at the outside, have wider limits than from
1 to 2, and, furthermore, is itself very questionable. We may state the whole matter
in other terms, as follows                   :




     The assumption that the persons dying in any age-group represent the living
may   possibly be defective in two particulars, to which reference may now appro-
priately be made.   First, the frequency of death among the section of the community
with estates sufficiently large to come under review for probate may perhaps be less
than the average on account of their better financial ability to secure themselves
against adverse influence.    In some countries this is unquestionably the case, but
in Austraha the favourable climatic conditions would probably minimise such a
consequence. Unquestionably, no assumption one way or the other can be made
with safety.                death is less frequent among the rich, there will be larger
                         Of course,     if

numbers                         than is implied by dividing by the average death-rate
                  of rich persons living
(or multiplying by its reciprocal), and the result foimd without regard thereto, viz.,
{Rui/'Sw) will be too small i.e., R must be multiplied by a factor somewhat greater
                                                 ;



than unity, 1 + I, say, that is A — 1 = li, if this were the only thing to be taken into
account see formula (23).
              ;




       On     the other hand, those                            whom       deatli eliminates at any age are evidently
differentiated vitally from those                              who       remain, and the question arises whether this
greater vital            endowment          is        characterised on the average                      by   greater   endowment   of
                                                                                                                                           .   ——

wealth.         If it      be   so, then it follows that the wealth factor (u = w/'Sw) should be
increased,       i.e., it       should be multiplied by a quantity somewhat greater than unity,
1+rj, say, or            if   this   were the only matter to be taken into account, A                                          — 1 = 71

the expression

     These two correction-factors are similar in kind, and in fact can hardly be re-
garded as distinct, forasmuch as the supposition that the living in any age-group may
be differentiated from the dying in respect of wealth may be regarded as including
also the differentiation in mortality due to wealth.    Both may, therefore, be em-
braced imder one factor, say (1 + ^), where ^ is sensibty equal to ^+ 7^ (forasmuch
as ^7j may be considered negligible) thus we may assume that A — 1 = ^+ 71 = ^.
                                                                    ;


Unfortunately no                     satisfactory data for the determination of these factors exist,
and at present we can safely infer nothing in regard to them, nor even obtain a rough
idea of the magnitude of their joint effect.

          If   we suppose that each age-group                               is    divided into classes corresponding to in-
dividual wealth, and that the death-rate has been ascertained for each,    and suppose
also that                                     not very large, any correction of the type
                the range of wealth in each class                            is

of Tj for any class in question will necessarily be negligible, and the correction may
then be regarded as of the type of ^. Remembering that the sum of the factors
w'/w, iv"/w, etc., is unity, we may put formula (23) in the following form, viz.:



                (26)                 f    =
                                                 W

                                                                                  —          .
                                                                                                  R"   - R

which shews that the correction depends on the proportioyi of the wealth contributed
by each class to the total, and the relative difference of the mortality rates. Since
R necessarily lies between the least and greatest values of R'            R^, some of
the quantities will be negative and some positive.

                  and non-probate classes. We may note first of all that the existing returns
do not afford the means of deducing the death-rate even of two such crucial divisions
as the non-probate and probate classes of the population.      For the data are                                                                 :

of the   probate class respectively, the total deaths being equal to those in the two

          If   we assume a            rate r' corresponding to d', the corresponding population                                                P'   is

determined           ;    and     P " = P— P (           ')   gives with d

                                                                                        '


inno way affected.    Or if we                            assume relations such as r' = gr, then we have P' =
d'/gr.  Or again, if we make                             r" = jr, that is, equal to yd' / P' = d"/ P" we have

at once yd' / d" = P'/P", and we can divide                                                  P in this ratio.
          The same can be done,of course, for each age-group.   As there is no valid
reason, however, for   assuming the values of p or y, we can infer nothing in regard
to the division of the population into non-probate and probate classes.

    16.   Life Assurance Society's experience of variations in death-rates, according
to size oJ policy, etc.   —
                        The experience of the Austrahan Mutual Provident Society
and of the Scottish Widows' Fund throws some light on the question of the relation
of wealth and mortality, and has consequently been considered.       We remarli first
that the possible variation to be expected in death-rates for any age-group may also
be roughly gauged by referring to the A.M. P. experience for the period 1849-1903.
Instead of considering a number of age-groups we may consider the large group for
the ages 20 to 59 only, and the same age-group for the Commonwealth for males for
1891-1900.       The   results are as follow   :




    Whole        Life Assurances       ..   Healthy .00723       Loaded .01053   Factor 1.46

This gives ua     some idea     of the range in the rates of mortahty.     It is not,   however,
              an age-group that we find what ie essential. It is the average, variation

100             The Estimation of Wealth fbom Probate Betubns.

      In the face of the preceding evidence, a priori judgmenta as to the correlation
between wealth and mortality must be regarded as of little value, and in any case it ia
quite certain that the occupational claaa "primary producers," with the lowest rate
of mortality, contains an immense majority who are certainly by no means wealthy.
A\'o have thus shewn not only that we are not entitled to regard the whole occupational

\-ariation of death-rate    as   applying to        the wealth-variation (since occupations
characterised   by a high rate of mortality   are   among those which are also characterised
by considerable wealth), but     also that the experience of life insurance in     AustraUa
lends no real support to the view.

wealth and mortality. The probate-returns shew that for Victoria in the years 1908-
1912 the distribution of wealth averaged aa follows        :

that financial resources can        command
                                       a degree of comfort and attention that conduce
to longevity.      The                             and considerable wealth, if it really
                         difference between moderate
be in favour of the latter, can however be only very slight. Thus, with some ex-
ceedingly slight degree of plausibility, it may be supposed that the persons of zero
wealth have the highest mortality-rate (or lowest factor R), and those of the greatest
wealth the lowest mortality-rate (or highest factor R),


     It should     be noted that the ratio (R' —                   R)/R   is   independent of the absolute
value of the death-rate, and the ratio w' /w                  is   similarly independent of the absolute
amount   of the wealth of each class within a group further, the relative numbers in
                                                                      ;



each class are necessary only to ensure that the weighted mean of the death-rate
gives the general death-rate.   Hence, we may regard the above table as a possible
representation of the existing facts, even               if   not a probable one.

     Having regard       to every aspect of the matter,    it is likely that the variation of

death-rate with wealth, if     it             does not pass through a mder range than say
                                    exist at all,
1 to \\ or 1.064 to 0.798.          Thus, taking into account the relative numbers in each
class,   the relative reciprocals of the death-rates                may    be (arbitrarily) assumed to be
those    shewn   in the following table, line       i.   being taken from the preceding table        :

thia it may be       aaid that the experience ofa large aasurance company neceasarily
includea a, very large body of recently selected livea, and although the

experience, which haa been uaed, dates     back  to 1849, the number   of policies issued

in the earlier years of the Company's history was so small, compared with
                                                                             the number

issued in more recent years, that the experience may properly be regarded
which medical selection had played a very prominent part. The effect produced by
thia cause is that a rate of mortality shewn is much lighter than that
                                                                       experienced by a

similar      body   of lives not subject to   medical selection, and consequently for the
purpose in view the A.M.P. rate must be considered       aa being pr..>lmbly unduly favour-
able,    and aa giving too high a multipUer.

        It moreover, for reasons already pointed out, by no means certain or even
             is,

probable that the possession of wealth and acceptance as a satisfactory life by an
insurance office are coincident facts, or that the " healthy -life" experience of an
insurance office is to be considered as applicable only to the wealthy.    The signifi-
cance of the A.M.P. mortality rates for healthy and loaded lives appears in the follow-
ing table of the reciprocals of those rates (or rather the values of q^) which will be
           near for the purpose.

        In view of the fact that the value of 1 + ^ was found to be about 1.1490, cm
the   suppositions made, and that the result based on the 1901-1910 mortality, compared
with the A.M.P. experience of (1849-1903) for " healthy and loaded male lives,"
gives 1.1576, it might perhaps be assumed that a correction-factor of 1.15 is probably
justifiable.  This, however, I do not believe to be the case.   It would be so only                                                   if
the   assumption referred             to   had any   validity.     After a wide review of the question, and
in the light of all the available evidence, it                    seems that in Australia at any rate, there
is   grave reason to doubt the existence of a definite correlation of wealth and longevity,
and,    if so, the supposition by means of which ^ weis estimated above has no validity.

It is certainly not              based upon evidence, and rests merely upon a more or less plausible
assumption, against which, as has been shewn, there                                    is   at least           some evidence.
        We now           indicate the numerical consequences of a difference in the mortality
rates of classifications              according to wealth within the same age-group



        1 9.       Consequence o£ death-rate being less among the wealthy.
                                                                   Suppose that the                             —
population at             any age
                        divided into two classes differing in wealth, and that the
                                      is

wealthy experience a lower rate of mortality than the less wealthy. This will have
the effect of altering the distribution with the lapse of time                                            (when the transfer         of
the survivors of             any age-group to a group                 of greater            age    is   considered).            It will
follow as              a consequence that the aggregate of the wealthier classes will tend to
relatively increase           with age as compared with the aggregate of the less wealthy
class,       other things being equal.               Other consequences will also follow, which we shall
now proceed             to consider.        We shall assume that          :




               (i.)    The average unit of wealth is w'                           for the         poorer            sub-group   ;   and
                        lu' (H- u') for the richer sub-group                  ;




               (ii.)    That     this unit does not increase          with time, or               if it   does increase, that         it

                         increases with time always              by the same            ratio       whether the amount be
                         large or small

             (iii.)    That the death-rate for the poorer sub-group                                is     r,    and   for the richer
                         () h), where h is a positive quantity.

The following propositions follow as a necessary consequence of these three assump-
tions    :




             (a)   Since    by hypothesis the numbers of the poorer sub-group are decreasing
                        more rapidly than those of the richer sub-group, the ratio of the numbers
                        dying with large estates (or paying probate) to the number dying with
                        small estates (or who do not pay probate) should le7id to be an increasing
                        ratio.

             (h)   Since by hypothesis the individual wealth of the persons remaining alive
                     is unaltered, and, owing to the greater death-rate of the poorer sub-

                        group there are relatively fewer in that group, the average                                           for the
                        combined sub-groups must tend to increase with age.
                                                                                                                                 —
104                        The Estimation of Wealth from Probate Returns.

              (c)    Since     by hypothesis the individual wealth is the same, and death has more
                           rapidly decreased the poorer sub-group than it has the richer sub-group,
                           the ratio of the aggregate possession of the latter to the former will be
                         an increasing                ratio.


      These results are perhaps seen more clearly when set out formally (algebraically).
In the table hereunder m denotes the numbers in the poorer sub-group, and n those
in the richer, the death-rates being respectively r and (r—h).       After a unit of time
the groups are reduced by death to to ( 1 — r) and n[l — {r-h)] respectively, and the
aggregate of wealth will be as shewn in the table hereunder, provided we suppose
that the wealth does not pass by death to persons in the same age-groups.  The processes
by means of which the various quantities are obtained are obvious.

        The above, however;                      represents only the effect on the living.                                           We can establish
the     ceise for     the dying in a similar way.

    Let the persons in the two classes, each individual possessing respectively w'
and w' (\           +
            m'), be again                        m
                           and n and the respective death-rates initially r, and r^.
                                                                     ;



Then the average wealth, when a unit of time has elapsed, will be                                                            :




                              Total wealth of dying                               mr^w' -'rnr^w'iX + u')                             I                        nr u'

If,   then,        we suppose that               r^    and      r^       change with time in the same ratio, say become
ur^   and      ur^ (therefore that they preserve the                             same ratio to each other) then we have                                                       :

be    less    than unity, thus                the wealth-average will                  become       greater.


        important to observe that the expressions (27) and (28) cannot be used with
        It is
any great assurance todeditce values of r, and r„, because they represent, after all,
very small changes. We shall illustrate this point by considering n numerical
instance.

     The death-rate for the age-group 60 to 70 for "persons" ia about 0.034.   Suppose
then that we assume c, is about .04, and r, about .02, and that the ratio of     to ji ia                                                             m

Then in these two last expressions we should have                                                            :

          ItwiU be seen that the influence                                       is   extremely small           l
                                                                                                                  for even so great a difference
of   r,   and r, as is implied in the ratio                                      2 to       1.     It   is   moreover evident that so small a
quantity could                           lie   easily      masked by other elements                          affecting the results, viz., changes
in the rate of r.cciunulation of wealth, irregularities in                                                                   the deaths, in the sizes of
estates coming under review, and so on; in fact, it goes far to shew that no analysis
of the respective numbers or of the respective amounts appearing in age-groups is
likely to lead to anything definite, either as to relative mortality among the non-
probate and probate classes, or as to the possible rate at which the wealth of either
actualh" grows.



    In the preceding table shewing symbolically the averages for the living at the
commencement and end       of a period, the results, on the basis supposed, would be
respectively (1 + 0.40 u') and (1 + 0.041517 u'), so that the difference between the
beginning and end of a period will be relatively very small, and the conclusion                                                                            drawn
equally applies, for although u'                                      may be large the relative changes therein will be small.



     20.   Existing statistical data point to the conclusion tliat the devolution-rate
method must be applied to each sex separately. The returns of Victoriafor 1908-1912,              —
given in the table hereunder, shew that there is a remarkable constancy in the ratio
of the number of the non-probate to the probate class, from 40 to 90 years of age for
both males and females, and certainly to somewhat regular changes in the average
wealth in each age-group, but, as already pointed out, nothing can be deduced from this
table in regard to the relative death-rates of the probate and non-probate classes.
Column (7), shewing the wealth per head of the dying, reveals a marked increase with
age, the maximum being, for males, in the group 80-89, and tlie maximum for females
in the group 70-79.    This difference shews, of course, that the factors a and k will differ
for the sexes.    Other striking features of difference are that the wealth per head is
roughly between three and four times as great for the males as for the females, and
that the ratio of the non-probate to the probate class differs materially.         The con-
clusion is that separate returns should he made out for nudes and females, and, in com-
putations of total wealth, that formulae (3) to (12), and (19) to (28) camiot be applied
to the sexes taken together on the assumption that they may be considered as forming
a homogeneous population.                                            The same observation                        is   accentuated by the character-




      l.liu'         =       0,      the ratio of the lower quantity to the upper                                is   1.0;    if   W =   1.00, the ratio   becomes
1.0031    ;    if   infinity, it               becomes 1.0155.

    We     proceed   now   to consider the question of the influence of variations in the
distribution of wealth according to age,      and in mortality according to age, upon the
devolution-rate factors      a and   k.




     21.    Variation in the relative amounts contributed in each age-group and its
consequence.   — It is now evident how profoundly the "distributionof wealth accord-
ing to age" affects the results.  This distribution, viz., the system of ratios for each
age-group of w/'Zw, (u in the tables for Mctoria, 1908-1912) is very variable from year
to year, but in general shews no sign of definite progression.      The uncertainty of
individual results has already been estimated,        and   is   seen in the table hereunder of
values of a'   and k'   for Victoria,     shewing how variable these factors
                                                                       are, notwith-
standing that in the former the effect of the particular death-rate for the year, as
well as total wealth disclosed in probate, has been eliminated, and in the latter the
effect of the total wealth only.




     Attention has alreadj^ been drawn to the differences in the values of u and of pw
for Victoria in successive years. The distribution-effect is seen also in the difference
of the results for   New   South "Wales and those for Victoria.        The values   for   a and   k,
corrected so as to give tlie results for infinitesimally small groups, are      :

South Wales and Victoria. For the limited periods of time for which the necessary
data are available identity of distribution is by no means characteristic. This is
shewn by the table hereunder, in which are given the results for Victoria for
1908-15 (see Fig. 4, page 132), and those for New South Wales for 1911-13 and

     We shall now consider the causes of the irregularities referred to and the            mode   of
eliminating their prejudicial effect.


     22.  Necessity for a coirection for infrequent appearance of large estates. ^Very     —
large estates appear but infrequently in probate returns, the infrequency increasing
with the size of the estate and diminishing with the size of the population. Let us
consider any table shewing the number of estates of different magnitude in any
territory {e.g., the table from the Prussian Betums).  It is manifest that if we take
the devolution-period to be 22.2 years (which perhaps, however, is somewhat below
the correct amount), the average frequency in Prussia of the appearance of estates of
these sizes, in   probate aggregate for all age-groups, will be the number existing
                   a,

divided into the devolution-period.  Thus, if we call this period K, and the number
N, the frequency, F, is N/K, or the average interval of appearance K/N. It ia
obvious from this that the average frequency of appearance in a particular age-group
will be -considerably less. If we assume that it is equally likely to appear in the
probate-class in any age-group, then the relative frequency in that age-group to the
frequency of appearing in the aggregate of the age-groups is measured by the number
of probates in the former to the number for the latter (the aggregate number).

     Let the number of probate estates in any age-group be denoted by E', with a
suffix to define the particular group, and the number for all groups by E = ^E'
then this relative frequency is only the ( E'/E)th part of what we found before, since
the average frequency for the age-group is               :




         (29).            .F'= F       .   E'/E.

     Thus,   if   we    take the   number    Tc,   the multiplying factor deduced for Victoria for
the period 1908-1912, multiplied            by the     ratio of the Prussian death-rate to the Vic-
torian death-rate,    we obtain 22.2, which may be regarded as holding approximately
for Prussia.      Accepting this, we should get the following results         :

 Hi                      The Estimation of Wealth from Pbobate Returns.

      Suppose, for example, a very large estate comes under review in probate returna,
 say once in 7 years (on the average). Then for the (average) six years in which such
 an estate has not appeared the computed results will be in defect, because the estate is in
 existence, though the evidence of that existence and the measure of its magnitude
 are not to hand.   On the other hand, suppose it is included in an annual, or even in a
 quinquennial mean. The result will be greatly in excess of the true annual result,
 and   sensibly in excess of the true qimiquemiial result.
         A more         or less definite appreciation of this consideration has, without doubt,
 led statisticians to regard with favour a multiplier           which does not oscillate rapidly
like that derivedfrom the results of a single year. But it has ordinarily been for-
gotten that even when such a multiplier is xised, a single year's results are of very
limited value. The conclusion is that in order to improve the technique a study
must be made when               sufficient returns are to     hand   of the frequency of estates of different
sizes.           For   this reason   it is   important that tabulations should be         made   of sizes of
estates in different age-groups.                 From   the table of values of   pu   —see formula    (11)
the important grovips are  less than 30 :   —
                                         30 to 49    50 to 69
                                                          ;    70 and over; the
                                                                        ;             ;


extra work, however, involved in tabulating in smaller groups would not be con-
siderable, and it would be a great advantage in studying the characteristic of wealth
frequency and its variation with age. As already pointed out, there is an average
annual progression in the value of p of a sensible amount. In the following tables the
frequency for estates of various magnitudes are given, but not the distribution of
this frequency according to age.
     In general, however, not only are the data insufficiently complete, but also it is
impracticable to apply corrections for     tlie appearance or non-appearance of large

estates   it is preferable, therefore, to take the mean of a sufficient range of years
             ;


to be able to accept the result as substantially accurate.


       23.        Example     of variations in the   k and their consequences. The
                                                          factor                                     —
impossibility of regarding the results deduced   from any one year as at all satisf actorv
owing to the infrequent appearance of large estates and other irregularities in the
data, is well illustrated by taking the Victorian yearly data for the years 1908 to 1915.

    It may be noted also that these averages would correspond to the date 1912.0,
and indicate that the uncorreoted estimate for the wealth of Mctoria (including the
absentees) was then 1254,921,000, of which 72.9613 per cent, belonged to males, and
27.0387 per cent, belonged to females.
      These results for \'ictoria                  may              be compared with those of                         New           South AVales in
section 21 herein.                The mean         of the tliree results are k                               =    27.75       and   39. o7 for males
and females respectively; but the three years 1911-13 taken together give 29.95
and 37.81 for the factors k. corrected for a continuous wealth curve. We thus have
the following results, \iz.                 :

the result being thus in very close agi-eenient for males, and in fair agreement for
females.     one constant is to be used for males and females combined, these must
                   If
be weighted according to the aggregates of wealth.  This gives (for the same periods):
Victoria (persons), k = 32.01      N.S.W. (persons), k = 31.43

1911 to 1915 (persons), k                  =    34.42       ;       or    if        we combine the           results for Victoria 1908-15
with those of  N.S.W. 1911-1915, weighted according to the totals of the probates
(including absentees),\'iz., for tiie former 64.66 millions sterUng, for the latter 50.41

millions, we get for " persons" 33.07 for the two States combined, which would

that the factor k varies with changes in the distribution of wealth according to age,
and also with relative variations of mortality according to age (u and p). The latter
must, of course, be (imperfectly) reflected in the general death-rates. This will now
be considered.   For the C'ommonwealth and Queensland with a distribution of
wealth according to age at least approximately correct, we found values, see § 11,
which gave the following values for k, when corrected from 5-year groups so as to
give a continuous distribution instead of groups, \iz., the                                                        numbers          in the first   two

      Ratio of Absentees to Probate Totals, excluding Absentees.*
                                            The Rate of Devolution.                                                 1J7


The opposite is the case with regard to annuities, pensions, superannuation allow-
ances, etc., which tend in the direction of causing an under-estimate of the amount of
wealth possessed by the living.   We proceed to form a quantitative estimate of these
influences on the results.

       From recent returns             it   appears that of the total claims under assurance policies
paid by       £issurance companies in Australia, about four -sevenths of the total is
              life

payable in respect of the death of the policyholder, and about three-sevenths in respect
of the maturity of policies.                For the      five years 1908 to 1912, the total
                                                                          amount of the
claims     made      in Australia under assurance policies was £11,884,748, which, on
                                                  life

the basis quoted above, would represent a payment of about £6,790,000 in respect
of death benefits. For the five years under consideration, the amount of the assurance
policies in force in \'ictoria represented about 32 per cent, of the total for Australia,
and consequently the payment for death benefits in Victoria in respect of life
assurance policies was approximately 0.32 X £6,790,000, or about £2,170,000 in the
aggregate for the five years 1908 to 1912, or say, on the average £434,000, in a year.

    Similarly, for the same period, the amount paid as annuities by                                 life   assurance
companies in Victoria was approxinaately £25,000 per annum.

       From the       returns of one of the largest of the Austrayan companies,                            it   appears
that, as at 31st   December, 1913, the appropriate reserve value of sums assured and
bonuses aggregating to £96,750,000 was £29,300,000, or about 30% of the face value
of the policies, while, in the case of life annuities of £79,000 per armum, the capitalised
value was £665,000, or on the average about 8.4 years' purchase. It would thus
appear that for the 5 years 1908 to 1912, the exclusion in the case of Victoria of con-
sideration of the special features of life assurance    and annuity policies would have the
effect of overstating       the wealth of that State by k times 70 per cent. " of £434,000,
or about £300,000          X k,      in respect of assurance,       by the absolute
                                                                       and   of imderstating   it

amount of £25,000 multiplied by                     8.4, viz.,                 The
                                                                 £210,000 in respect of annuities.
quantity k denotes the appropriate multiplier used for converting amount subject to
probate into total wealth.   With a multiplier of say 32,' the net result would be
an overstatement of about £9,400,000 in the estimate of the total wealth of Victoria.
A correction for this would reduce the estimate to about 96 per cent, of the uncor-
rected total wealth.*   Consequently, in order to allow for the overestimate due to
the falling-in of life policies at death, the results for the Australian States should be
multiplied      by about        0.96.



    28.  Ratio oJ net to gross values of estates in probate returns. In certain cases      —
the only available data are the gross values of the estates appearing in probate
returns.      Where      this   is   the case,   it is    clearly necessary to deduce the latter            from the
former in order to ascertain the total private wealth.                               Unfortunately, however,
complete information does not exist as to the relation between the two values,
inasmuch as available information connecting these extends back only a few years.
The circumstances are different in each State each will therefore be referred to in
                                                                   :

     This ratio or factor of reduction is, however, not uniformly distributed in regard
to age, as one might naturally expect, and differs for males and females. It has
consequently been taken out in sex and age-groups, the results being as follows                                                 :

      The ratio           of the net to gross values appears for every age to be characteristically
different for males and females. A curve drawn through the group-values for each
sex indicates that the enciunbrance on estates increases in each to the age of about
35 or 36, and then diminishes, the ratio of net to gross values being about 0.67 in
the case of males, and about 0.815 in the case of females. This dissimilarity is
confirmed when the results are taken out for all ages in one group, the result for
Victoria for the period 1908-1912 being as follows :—

      Including absentees Males                       .85176         Females .90139                     Persons       .86167

     Except that there is less encumbrance on the estates of females, the two con-
tinuous curves, which are indicated by the group-values in the preceding table, are
very similar.              (See Fig.   7,   page       133.)

      The      shew that males and females cannot be regarded as a homogeneous
                facts
group, and consequently probate results should not be grouped together for " per-
sons," but kept separately for males and females    the grouping of them together    ;



tends to increase the measure of uncertainty when deductions are made of the total
private wealth either from net or from gross value.

      New           South Wales.     —The relation             of gross     and net values           for   Xew     South Wales
depends upon returns for the decade 1902-1911.                                           Mr.   J.   B. Trivett. Statistician
of that State, gives the results,   shewn later, from Probate Com-t and Stamp Duty
returns     ;           Year Book, New South Wales, 1912, p. 257. The oross value
                see Official
irrespective of encumbrances, was shewn in his report, also the net \alue of the
estates, since it is upon these that the duty is paid. The two returns liave not been
co-ordinated year by >'ear, however, and the nmnbers are not in exact aoreement
inasmuch as Probate Court returns refer to the year ending 31st December and the
Stamp Duty               returns to the year ending 30th June.
     This involves some difficulty in ensuring a satisfactory determination of the
ratio in question.   However, the UA-ei'age ratios for the periods 1902-5, 1906-8
1909-111, are 0.8322, 0.86(i!l, and 0.9526 respectively, while (lie ratio for the whole
period 1902-11 is 0.8907, though the mean of the tlu-ee ratios is only 0.8839. The
results indicate that for Ne«- South \\'ales there is probably an increase of about
0.018 per       annum on a mean                  of   about    O.SS-t,   and for Victoria about 0.017 on about

that of       New      South Wales.
                              Such results cannot, of course, be extrapolated in order
to discover the relationship between net and gross values for earlier periods.

                                                            results we obtain a factor for
the   Commonwealth,                   which may be applied throughout if we assume
                                  viz., 0.8620,

that this relation is constant.    Such assumption is, of course, a precarious one, for
it is quite possible that the indication of the results for New South Wales for the past

ten years and those for Victoria apply generally.

example, where the values of the estate are found to be quite different from what
initially appeared to be the case   the latter denote actions taken by the probate

initially arise, not the State to which they are referred. In view of the great measure
of uncertainty in the " multiplier," however, it will suffice to add their values to
the probate-totals.


                                                                         —
          Corrections for wealth passing by settlements. In Chap. I., § 1, of this part,

p. 68,       mentioned that de Foville has shewn that account must be taken of
            it   is

settlements, which are virtually anticipations of inheritance, and also that Gini has
established that, in Italy, the interval                  between successive settlements was sensibly
equal to the interval between successions.
     It is obvious that when wealth is conveyed by gift during a lifetime, the act of
conveyance operates to reduce the amount wTiich otherwise would have appeared
later in the probate returns of the donors, and it increases the wealth of the donees,
who in general are of «, younger age. It thus unduly diminishes the estimate of
wealth.   It differentiates, according to age, the living from the dying, by enriching
the former at the expense of the latter. Hence, from this point of view, it is evident
that if all settlements were made just before death, the fundamental assumption,
that the dying are a fair sample of the living, requires that the deduced amount of
aggregate wealth in any age-group shall be corrected by adding the amount of the
settlements at the age of the donors to theamount appearing in the probates that                              :

                                                                                were

                                                                   k could be apphed
throughout proportional to the probate amounts, the general factor

to their sum to find the correction to the aggregate of wealth
                                                                      accordmg                                     to age.         If-

      AR.un, if all the don,x-s, assumed to be the younger,
                                                  probates would   have the eHect of unduly
receiving a settlement, the inclusion in their
iiicreasiiH/ the estimate of wealth.  For if they were a years younger than the donor of
                                                                                 the case of
age X. they would appear in the aggregate result as B^.^s^, whereas, in
the donor dying, they would have appeared as R^6^, a much
                                                                       smaller amount, be-

cause from age 12 onwards, the factors R decrease, and with growing rapidity as age
advances. It would thus appear that a correction of the amount ZiR^-f^s^) must
always be an excessive one.    The correction Z{R^s^) can hardly be an excessive
one.   and probably would generally be in defect.              Of course, in respect
both of donors and donees it is obvious that the number of settlements will not
coincide, case for case, with the nmiiber of deaths.    For this reason it maj' be neces-
sary to have regard to the effect, not only of the settlements in any current year, but
of past settlements also, in disturbing the fundamental assumption on which the
whole di'\'olution-rate dp|ifuds, viz., that the dying and living at any age are identi-
caU^' characterised as regards wealth.     In the absence of complete data, however, a
rigorous solution is not wortli attempting, and would be of little value       it may be                       ;



assumed 1 hat the error of adding the aggregate of the settlements to the aggregate of
the probates will be negligible.
     Settlements are of two classes, (i.) those that come under notice and are duly
recorded (registered settlements)   (ii.) those which take place pri^'ately (a) by way
                                                   ;



of evading probate duties, (6) are informal gifts of value (i.e., are transfers of wealth
without consideration)   or (c) are formal gifts from " natural love and affection,''
                                      ;



etc.  Of the recorded ones some will later fall into the probates through the death of
the donees, and the question arises how far a deduction should be made from the
aggregate amount of the probates by way of correction. This inquiry fails, however,
for    want   of data.

       The                         New South Wales and of Victoria (the latter
              registered settlements of
probably coming into cognisance through the insoh'ency proceedings) are as follows                                                  ;

     The amount was 115.2 times the duty paid, which gives about £1,725,700 as an
annual average of the settlements. Since the annual average net wealth appearing
in the probate returns was £8,256,640 (including absentees), this sum represents no
lessthan 20.91% of the total, and cannot therefore be neglected. On the whole,
it isthought that to incorporate the entire amount with the probate-aggregates as
suggested, will not cause an overestimate of the wealth, indeed, in view of the fact
that a large number of settlements do not come under observation at all (e.g., mar-
riage settlements which are often considerable), it is possible that the error is one of
considerable defect.^                V\e    may    therefore talie 20.9 per cent, as the necessary cor-
rection,       and therefore 1.209 as the correi'tion-factor for the effect of settlements,
i.e.,   in   ^"ictoria, and in the absence of definite information for the rest of Australia.

State m. the Australian              Commonwealth which has compiled returns shewing for each
year of age           number        of probates,        and the net values       of the States represented.
These afford the necessary indication of                     tlie    variableness of the    numbers and values
for different ages,           and thus they reveal one            of tlie essential limitations of the       probate
method        of estimating wealth, unless the returns are spread over a considerable
number               apply to a very large population.
              of years or                                   In the following table the
number        of       given for each age, also the number of probates and the aggre-
                   deaths     is

gate of their net values.    The smoothed values of these are also given the net                         :




values per probate are deduced from the smoothed results, and these values are again
given.   The ratio of probates to deaths are also given for each age.
     The numbers for each age and sex for the years 1908-1915 inclusive, are given on
Fig. 8, see p. 134, the zigzag lines denoting the successive triennial age-means, and
the curves giving the smoothed results for the same total. ^
        The aggregate values            of the probate estates for each age              and sex are shewn by
Pig. 9, see p. 134, the zigzag lines                      denoting in this case the quinquennial age-
means.         The curves are the smoothed                 results    with the same      totals.'

                        shews the average wealth per probate for each age and sex
        Fig. 10, see p. 135,
on Curves A and B, the dots and crosses denoting respectively the results as gi\'en by
the smoothed values for males and females respectively.    The circles and squares are
the quinquennial age-means of quotients obtained from the numbers and values of
probates for three consecutive ages, attributed to the middle age. The law of in-
crease with age m the average value of probates is thus seen not to be very definite.

        Curves C and D, on Fig.              10,   shew    for   males and females respectively the ratio of
probates to deaths according to age.                         The dots shew the values deduced                for the
smoothed           results.       The smoothed          results, agreeing therewith, are            denoted by the
continuous curves             :    the general indication of these are shewn by the more regular
broken curves, marked C and D           '



     In the following table the data are given on which each of the curves referred to
is based, as also the smoothed results obtained therefrom                        :




      1. The essence of the question is as follows               —
                                                          Consider a population perfectly homogeneous in
                                                             :


                                                                                                     —
respect to the dying  and living as regards the distribution of wealth according to age a population in
which no settlements have taken place. When, in such a population, a person of any given age makes
a settlement on another (of the same or some other age) the effect is to disturb the pre-existing homo-
geneity.   When the donor dies his estate will be in defect, while the estate of the donee, if livmg, will
be in excess. Hence, when the donor's estate is multiplied by the ratio of the living to the dying, it
would not even represent (if the donee were of the same age) the wealth ol the living irrespective of the
increase due to the settlement.
     This point of view takes no account, however, of the rate of growth of wealth from the point of
time at which the settlement was made, or of the possible fart that the rate of growth may itself
possibly be an ascertainable function of age, and may not be a question merely of accumulation accord-
ing to the general rate of int^erest. In fact, there la reason to believe that the rate of increase of wealth
is appreciably greater for the period 48 to 55 years of age (for males) than for any other period.

     2. The ordinates to the curves at the middle of the year-ranges give the number for the particular
year of age in question.
     3. The results for individual years of age are so irregular that it was preferable to take the           mean   of
5 consecutive years of age and attribute them to the middle year of age.

     32.   Distribution according to age probably not constant.     In order to obtain      —
the values in the table of § 25, a constant relative distribution of aggregate wealth
according to age-groups was assumed.        Such constancy is, however, improbable.
'We may now consider the question further. If the ratio of the number of probates
to the total number of persons dying in a given age-group be constant from year to
year, and the death-rate in that age-group be also constant, it will follow as a
consequence that the numbers of probates will vary from year to year as the
numbers living in the given age-group of the population, and if at every date the
average wealth for that group be relatively the same {i.e., similarly related but
not necessarily identical in amount) the aggregate amounts of the probates in that
age-group will vary as the numbers in short, the wealth in any age-group will vary
                                                   ;



with the population in that group.   Thus, if we have the absolute or relative con-
stitution according to age of the population at                       two dates,         i.e., if   we have   for each

date, eitlier

          (32)           P   =     Pj   +    P^    +   etc., or   1   =   :Pj   +   ^2    +   etc.,

we can deduce       one date the probate distribution of the relative amount of the
                   for
probates from the given distribution at the other date. As in Chapter II. of this
part, let Ux denote w^/Ew, and in (32) above let accented quantities denote values
at any particular date, which are to be referred to a date for which the distribution
is l^nown, then, subject to the assumption referred to holding good, we have                                  :

the constants g and Ji being so taken that      = 1. Thus a probable distribution
scheme (series of values of «') can be deduced, based upon linown age-distributions
of the population.        Similarly,        it   could be based upon the ratio of the                    number       of
deaths occurring in the various age-groups.

           Combined corrections. Owing to the fact that the data as regards probates
are complete only for " gross values." and that the limitations of the data preclude
all possibility of attaining to precision in the estimates of total private wealth from
probates, the practical solution may be simplified. Thus it will suffice to take the
product of the individual corrections and apply this product to the totalfor Australia.
The product of the corrections for assurance for settlements and for the reduction
of gross to net values is 0.96 x 1.209 x O.S(i2 = 1.0005   hence, we may accept the      ;




gross values without correction and apply the values of k thereto to obtain the aggre-
gate of the wealth.

          Empirical correction of probate results. The question still remains to be
settled whether probate results can be expected to agree with census results without
further correction. As shewn on p. 28, the aggregate private wealth of Austraha
was £1,643,463,376. In a district whose population was 77,350, the total debt for
males was about 0.00315 of the assets, for females about 0.00124, and for persons
0. 00261). the ratio of the numbers in debt compared with those who (as declared)

possessed assets being respectively 0.04340, 0.01433, and 0.02978.      The total number
of returns in this district was 25,932 out of a total population (all ages) of 77,350, i.e.,
very sliglitly over one-third. See p. 34 herein. The totalnumber of " not accounted
for" in the whole '\Var Census was          males, 1,147,623     females, 1,614,461
                                                                 :                       or  ;                       ;




persons, 2,762,084.     Any correction for the amount of debt referred to would be
insensible compared with the opposite correction for shortage of returns, and may
therefore be wholly ignored.

    The k factor for the year 1915 is 34.07 (later calculation, 34.99); see § 25, p 115.
and the probate aggregate for that year (gross values) is £29,353,000 the product                      ;



of the two is £1,000,057,000 (or £1,027,061,000); hence, to convert the probate
estimate into the census estimate of £1,643,463,376, it is necessary to multiply by
1.6425 (or 1.600161).               We          could therefore apply this factor to the values of k in the
table in§ 25 (or 1.60016 to those in the later table),                              and thus obtain the values shewn
in the table hereinafter               ;    see p.        130.

          The growth o£ Australian wealth. In the following table are shewn the
gross values of both the Testate and Intestate estates in Australia for the years 1878
to 1915 inclusive.               The   figures for         Western Australia were not available from 1878 to
1892, but were estimated in the following                            manner     :




     The average value of all estates in the Commonwealth (less Western Australia)
was found for the quinquennia 1878-1882 and 1896-1900. These values were £1844
and £2044 respectively. It was assumed that the average value of estates increased
linearly from 1880 to 1898, the annual increase in value being (2044— 1844) '18= £11.1.
In Western Australia the average value of estates for the quinquennium was found
to be £1593.    This was then reduced in tlie ratio of tire linearly changing figures
referred to, carrying on the change past 1880 to 1898.      This method was deemed to
be    sufficiiuitly       accurate for the piu'pose in view.                        Tlio figures for Intestate Estates
in   Tasmania from H7S       1         to   1   .SS4   were computed         in a similar    manner.

          (ii.)       Though the use             of quinquennial averages diminishes this irregularity, it
is insufficient                to reduce   it   to an insensible amount even the combination of the data
                                                                          :

                                       —
marriage settlements which latter are rarely recorded is an essential. If the             —
proportion of settlements to probates be large, it is further necessary that the ages of
donors and donees also be given, otherwise, the uncertainty of the result will be
appreciable.                   The   effect of settlements in disturbing the                  normal distribution            of
wealth requires special investigation.
     (v.) To estimate the wealth in any age-group, the ratio of living to the dying

should be the weighted average for the period considered, and inasmuch as this ratio
sensibly changes from year to year, account should be taken of the change.
     (vi.) A correction is necessary in order to allow for the fact that, from the stand-

point of averages, life insurance unduly increases the probate-return, and to that
extent creates a wealth-differentiation between the living and dying. Existing
statistics            admit of only a rough correction.
          (vii.)       Net values are necessary in all cases where precision                    is   required   :   it is   not
satisfactory to correct                    by a general factor      of reduction (gross to net values).
          (   viii.   )   Statistics are needed, to shew whether death-rates vary with the wealth of
individuals                :   without this the rigour of the method is uncertain. Such statistics
are not at present available.
          (ix.)           An   estimate    made        in respect of an average taken over a quinquennial
or   a,   decennial period             may           with advantage be ordinarily assigned to the middle of
the period, but is not the value as at that particular date.

         In Australia the probate-method cannot lead to satisfactory results owing
          (x.)

to the absence of the necessary data regarding settlements.   This defect introduces
great uncertainty into determinations from probates, a fact forcibly illustrated by
the necessity of applying a correction-factor of about 1.6 to the results obtained
from probates, in order to bring them into agreement with the estimates obtained by
the       War         Census.

PART VI,—THE INVENTORY METHOD OF ESTIMATING WEALTH.


 CHAPTER 1.—ESTIMATE OF AUSTRALIAN PRIVATE WEALTH FOR                                                              1915.



     1.  General.        —
                    Of the various methods of estimating the wealth of the community
the inventory method is that which furnishes most readily a comprehensive view of
the various classes of wealth constituting the aggregate. In this respect it has ad-
vantages which do not attach to either the succession (probate) method or the census
method.        The     possibility of using         it,     however,      is   largely dependent on the existence
of valuations of varioiis kinds              made         for purposes other         than the estimation of          total
wealth,        example. Local Government assessments, values of imports, values
             as, for
of plant and machinery engaged in various industries, etc.     Further, in certain of
the items direct valuation is not possible, and estimates based on indirect data and
general knowledge must be employed, as, for example, an estimate of the value of
clothing based on the         known number of persons, and an assumed value per                                 head, or
a valuation of furniture based on the number of houses of various sizes or of various
rental values.   It is thus clear that, in common with all other estimates of wealth,
the inventory method           is   involved in some measure of uncertainty, but it is doubtful
whether      this is   more marked than       in the case of other methods. On the other hand
it   has the advantages        (i.)   that     it   enables a fair idea to be obtained of the degree of
uncertainty involved in each item,                   (ii.   )   that unlike a census          it   costs little to compile
and can consequently be prepared at  relatively short intervals, (iii.) that it relates
approximately to a definite point of time, whereas a " succession" estimate at its
best can only give the average for an extensive period                             if it is   to be at all reliable.


       2.    Basis oJ estimate.       —In the accompanying estimate provision has been made
for the inclusion of all material private wealth existing in Australia, whether owned
by persons domiciled in Australia or by those resident abroad, but public property
whether national or communal has been omitted.       Owing to this scheme it might
possibly be considered necessary to include in the aggregate an item representing
the securities for loans to Commonwealth and State Governments, and to public
bodies, which are held in Australia, since such holdings will in all cases be included
in succession returns and census results, and should thus be included to justify a
comparison of the results obtained by the several methods. Although such inclusion
might appear out of place in what is essentially a valuation ot material objects, it
might, perhaps, be possible to justify it on the view that the amount so included
represents the portion of the national and communal property for wh ich private inivstors
resident in Australia hold certificates of                        title   in the   shape of bonds, debentures or
stock.

     It is not clear, however, that h, similar contention in favour of including the
Australian public debt held outside the Commonwealth would not have equal validity.
In view of all the circumstances it was decided to omit any reference to the public
debt    in   the main estimate, but to refer to                      it later in    making comparisons with the
succession and     War Census results.
       In Ijroad (•ntline the classes of private wealth contribviting to the aggregate
may be       classed     as follows    :

represents about two-thirds of tlie total estimated wealth. The form in which this
information would be most serviceable is that of improved capital value, but
unfortunately particulars of this nature are available for the whole State in the cases
of Victoria  and South Australia only.     Similar information in the cases of New
South Wales and Western Australia is furnished for " municipalities'' only, the
assessments for " shires" in New South Wales and for the majority of the " road
districts" in Western Australia being upon an unimproved basis.       In Queensland all
the assessments are based upon unimproved values, while in Tasmania and in a few
of the Western Australian road districts tlie figures given relate to " annual values."
It   is   thus necessary in several cases to apply certain factors for the purpose of con-
verting "      unimproved" and " annual values" into the corresponding " improved
capital values."

          (a)   New   South Wales.   —The       valuation of the municipalities of       New       South
Wales for the year ended 31st December, 1915, furnished the following                    results   :




     New South Wales.        — Valuation    of Municipalities for   Year ended 31st Dec, 1915.
138               The Inventobt Method of Estimating Wealth.

         total area embraced by these municipalities is 2913 square miles, or less
       The
than   per cent, of the total area of the State, while the population contained therem
        1

represented more than 64 per cent, of the total population of the State.

     With the exception of a portion of the sparsely populated ^\'estem Land Division
the remainder of the State is divided into shires, which cover a total area of 180,655
square miles, or somewhat more than 58 per cent, of the whole area of the State, the
population of this portion representing nearly 35 per cent, of the total for the State.
The unincorporated area of the Western Land Division covers an area of 125,893
square miles, or rather more than 40 per cent, of the area of the State. Its popula-
tion,however, is rather less than 1 per cent, of the total population of New South
Wales.

     As regards shire valuations for 1915, the unimproved capital value is available
in all cases, and aggregates £104,745,633. Improved capital values which are
available for eleven shires aggregate £21,412,096, the unimproved values for the
same shires totalling £9,599,892, or 44.83 per cent, of the corresponding improved
values.  There were ten cases in which improved capital values and assessed annual
values were both given, the improved values aggregating £18,088,565, and the corres-
ponding assessed annual values £822,201, or 4.88 per cent, of the improved value.
On    the assumption that the eleven shires, quoted above as giving a percentage of
44.83 for the ratio of unimproved to improved value,  may be taken as a fair sample
in this respect of the shires of   New
                                    South Wales, the multiplier for converting the
aggregate unimproved value for shires into the corresponding improved value wUl be
100 H- 44.83. Applying this factor the improved capital value for shires works out
at £233,650,000.  It may be noted that the ratio of unimproved to improved capital
value obtained at the War Census of 1915 for owners domiciled in New South Wales
was     44.91 per cent.

     In the case of the unincorporated portion of the Western Land Division an esti-
mate of £10,000,000 unimproved value is quoted in the Official Year Book of New
South Wales for 1915 (p. 587), as being within reasonable limits. This estimate is
apparently based on the assumption that an unimproved value of 2s. 6d. per acre
might be taken as applying to the whole of the area of slightly more than eighty
million acres contained in the Western Division.      Although this estimate might be
appropriate for certain purposes, it appears somewhat high for adoption in the present
case, and it was considered desirable to prepare an estimate on the basis of the popula-
tion of the unincorporated area taken in conjunction with the average imunproved
value per head disclosed by the contiguous shires. These are the shires of Boomi,
Walgett, Marthaguy, Bogan, Lachlan, Carathool, Waradgery and Wakool, which in
1915 had an aggregate population of abovit 21,200. and an aggregate unimproved
valuation of £9,176,669, or £433 per head.    As the population of the unincorporated
area of the Western Division in 1915 was about 16.000, the corresponding miimproved
value would on this basis be £6,928,000. Particulars in respect of the ratio of " un-
improved" to " improved values" are not a\'ailable for this part of the State
separately, but as it would be relatively high it has been taken at 60 per cent., giving
an estimated improved value for the miincorporated area of tl 1.547,000.

        Combining these   results, the total for the State   works out as follows   :




                 Estimated Improved Capital Value,    New South    Wales, 1915.

     This total represents an average of £253 per head of the            mean population      of the
State for the year 1915.



    (b)   Victoria.   — In the case   of Victoria the particulars available relate to    improved
capital values,   and   also to   annual values for   all local   government   areas.   The   figures
for 1915 are as follows       :

       In the case of the Road Districts which correspond approximately to the shires
in    some other States, rates are levied in part on " annual values," but mainly on
"    unimproved values," both bases being used in some districts. For the whole State
the " annual values" recorded for the year ended 30th June, 1915, were £327,709,
while the " unimproved values" for the same year totalled £14,142,879. As in-
dicated in the preceding table, the ratio of "net annualvalue" to "improved capital
value" works out at 8.82 per cent, for extra-metropolitan municipalities in Western
Australia, but such a ratio   is   certainly too high in the case of road districts.   In the
case of    NewSouth Wales the ratio for country municipalities was 7.39 per cent.,
while that ascertained for eleven shires for which the information was available was
4.88 per cent., or about one-third less. Assuming the same relation to hold between
the extra-metropolitan municipalities and the road districts in Western Australia,
the appropriate percentage would be two-thirds of 8.82, or 5.88. It was consequently
decided to talie 6 per cent, as fairly applying to the case. At the War Census of
1915 the ratio of " unimproved" to" improved" capital value in respect of property
owners domiciled in Western Australia was 40.55 as this was based on a combination
                                                        ;



of    town and country   properties,   probably too low for use in connection with
                                        it is

country properties only. The factor to be applied in converting the " unimproved
values" quoted above into " improved values" has consequently been based upon a
ratio of -15 per cent.   As a result of these computations the " improved capital
value" for road districts has been estimated at £36,891,000.      Combining these
results the total for Western Australia may be stated as follows, the whole of the
State being incorporated      :

value per head indicated by the State estimates. In the Northern Territory the mean
population for 1915 was 4403, while the corresponding figure for the Federal Terri-
tory was 24tj7.   The average values per head of mean population disclosed above for
the several States are as follows      —
                                   New South Wales, £253 Victoria, £221 Queens-
                                   :                           ;                   ;



land, £187;   South Australia, £212; Western Australia, £192; and Tasmania,
£166.   In view of these averages it will probably be within the mark to assume an
average of £150 per head for the Territories. This will give approximately £660,000
for the Northern Territory, and £369,000 for the Federal Territory.


      {h)   Commonwealth.   — Combining the results obtained       in foregoing sub-sections,
the results for the   Commonwealth may be stated   as follows in thousands of pounds :—

    (iv.)   Manufacturing plant and machinery.   — In   all   the States returns are collected
and tabulated annually      in respect of all factories, a factory being defined as    an   in-
dustrial establishment in which four or more persons are employed or in which power
other than hand-power is used whatever number of persons are employed. These
returns include one relating to the approximate value of plant and machinery
employed in such factories, and the figures for 1915 have been used for the purposes
of the present estimate.   As, however, these figures include the value of plant and
machinery to the amount of some £2.237,000, employed in railway and tramway
workshops which are mainly Government establishments, a deduction has been
made of the whole of the value so shewn in the annual returns. This deduction is
probably somewhat in excess for this class of establishment, as some are private
concerns, but the, excess may be considered as a set-oft to the values associated
with other Government enterprises of a minor character.

case of the preceding item, the materials available for an estimate are meagre. It
is i'\'KltMit,   however,      tliat   the wealth represented   by the items coming imder   this

head must be       consideraljlo.

    The estimate was made in the following manner                       —
                                                         The Census of 3rd April,

according to the number of rooms, and according to the rental paid. The numbers
were as follows        ;

       The total for the Commonwealth represents an average of £15 lis. 6d. per head
of   the mean population for 1915, or £74 Ss. 9d. per occupied dwelling on the 1911
census average of 4.78 inmates per occupied dwelling.




     4. Aggregate of detailed estimates.         —
                                           On combining the detailed estimates given
in the preceding section, the total valvie of private wealth existing in Australia, ex-
clusive of private interests in national and communal property, is found to be ap-
proximately 1620 millions sterling, or i'i'21 per head of tlip mean population
of the Commonwealth for 1915.       As pointed out in section 2 of the present Chapter,
a comparison of this estimate with one based on a wealth census or on probate re-
turns is not satisfactory unless there be added to the inventory estimate an allowance
for the local holdings of Commonwealth, State and Mvmicipal securities, all of which
are brought to accovmt in the census and probate methods. At the 30th June, 1915,
the total amomit so held was approximately 140 millions sterling, making with the
sum quoted above, a total of 1760 millions as compared with the war census total of
1643 millions, and an estimate on the probate basis of little more than 1000 millions.
In view (i.) of the emergency nature of the war census, (ii. of the evidence of incom-
                                                                   )



pleteness furnished by the returns, and (iii.) of the tendency for persons furnishing
such retiu'ns to suspect taxation, and hence to furnish a conser^•ative estimate,     it is

probable that the 'War Census total         is   an understatement of the position.

           thus be seen that the result obtained by the inventory method, although
       It will
much              any previous estimates, is in the main corroborated by the wealth
               in excess of
census result.  A summary of the values obtained is furnished in the following
table      :

    For the sake of avoiding any possible misunderstanding of the significance of the
above figures, it may be well to again state here that v?hat they represent is an esti-
mate of the value of all the private material wealth existing in Australia at 30th
Juno, 1915, whether such wealth was owned by AustraHan residents or not. Pro-
perty situated outside Australia but owned by Australian residents is not included,
and immaterial wealth such as    title deeds, mortgage deeds, debentures, etc., is not,

as such, included at       the estimate being based entirely on the material private
                           all,

wealth itself, not in any way upon the individual titles thereto. National wealth in
the sense of the property of Commonwealth and State Governments, and communal
wealth in the sense of the property of the various local governing bodies, are not
included, nor has any allowance been  made for the fact that private investors are to a
very large extent monetarily interested in such property in consequence of advances
made by them by way of public and municipal loans. An estimate of the value of
national and communal property has not, on the present occasion, been undertaken.
One of the large items is the Government Kailways and Tramways, and the Municipal
Tramways, whose   cost of construction and equipment to 30th June, 1915, was about
£200,000,000.  These, together with public buildings and their sites. State and
municipal industrial undertakings, and some other branches of national and com-
munal property, are of course capable of approximate valuation, but there are in
addition such items as        (i.)   unalienated crown lands,       (ii.)   streets, roads   and   bridges,
(iii.)   harbours,   etc., for    which   it   would be    difficult to   devise a suitable valuation
basis.




              CHAPTER II.—EARLIER AUSTRALIAN INVENTORY ESTIMATES.


         1.    Estimate for 1890 and eailiei years.         —The    earliest estimate of this nature
made      in respect of Australia appears to be that           made
                                                     in 1892 by Mr. (now Sir) T. A.
Coghlan, who, at the time, was Government Statistician of the State of New South
 Vales.
"\       Particulars of this estimate were embodied in a paper read before the Aus-
tralasian Association for the Advancement of Science at its Hobart session in 1892,
and were subsequently published                in the   1892 issue of Coghlan's " Seven Colonies of
Australasia."        The estimate      relates not only to Australia,
                                                             but includes figiires for
New  Zealand, and also furnishes aggregates but not details in respect of Australasia
for 1813, 1838, and 1863.  As the settlement of New Zealand in a permanent manner
dates from 1840, the figures for 1813 and 1838 are necessarily pm-ely Australian,
while for 1890 the estimate for New Zealand is shewn in detail.    In the case of 1863,
liowHver, the only figures furnished are those reflating to    Australasia." For the
                                                                              '

              Comparison of Earlier Estimates with those for                 1915.   157


     On the other hand the estimate for 1915 shews in every item a substantial
advance on that for 1903. The largest increase is that of £421,693,000 in the value
of " land, houses and permanent improvements," while for all classes of wealth an
advance of £637,538,000 is shewn.

     Comparing the estimate for 1915 with that for 1890 there is in evidence an in-
crease in every item except that of live stock, the total increase shewn for the 25
years being £600,275,000.

    As a      partial explanation of the decline in estimated values between 1890    and
1903,   it   may
             be pointed out that the year 1890 occurred near the apex of a period of
exceptional and to some extent perhaps fictitious prosjierity, and that in consequence
prices, and especially the prices of real estate, were in an inflated condition.   The
subsequent collapse, followed and accentuated Ijy the banking crisis of 1893, and
supplemented by a series of unfavourable seasons, produced a condition of depression
which was only slightly relieved by the discovery and development of the sVestern
Australian Goldfields during the years 1893-1897. The outcome was that the prices
of commodities fell rapidly, and the fall in the prices of real estate was even more
marked. A further imfavourable influence in the case of 1903 was the fact that in
the season 1902-3 Australia experienced one of its most severe droughts.

      In the case of 1915 it should be noted that since 1896 there has been a fairly
continuous upward trend in the world's prices for practically all commodities,
accompanied in Australia by a marked recovery in the values of real estate. This
rise in the prices of commodities has been very marked since 1905, and has in recent
years been accentuated by the outbreak of war in 1914.

furnishes a comparison of the relative distribution of wealth according to class for
the estimates       made   in respect of 1890, 1903   and 1915   :

158                  The Inventory Method                          of Estimating Wealth.


       An   interesting feature of this comparison                      is   the very high proportion in each
case which     is          property in the form of " land, houses, and permanent
                    represented   iDy
improvements," ranging from 70.77 per cent, in the 1890 estimate, to 68.27 per cent.,
in that for 1915.

     Three of the items viz. (i. land etc. (ii. ) live stock, and (iii. mining properties,
                            ,
                                   ,
                                         )         ,          ,
                                                                                          )



occupied positions of diminishing relative importance at the successive estimates..
On the other hand, three items, viz., (i.) merchandise, etc., (ii.) shipping, and (iii.)
plant, machinery, etc., occupied positions of increasing relative importance.       In the
case of the two remaining items, viz.,                 (i.)       (ii.) household furni-
                                                                  coin and bullion, and
ture, etc., the estimates indicated                an     and subsequent increase in
                                                        initial decrease,
relative importance, the variation in the case of coin and bullion being very small.
In the main it may be said that the figures indicate a decline in the relative import-
ance of the primary sources of wealth, and an increase in the relative importance of
the accumulated products of industry in the shape either of goods available for con-
sumption or of mechanical and other aids to production.

       With the exception, however,           of the relative increases in the items " merchandise,,
etc.," and "plant, etc.," and the              relative decreases in the item "live stock," the
variations were not very marked.

 CHAPTER IV.—ESTIMATES OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH OF THE UNITED
                                            STATES OF AMERICA.

     1.  General.        —
                   The following particulars exhibiting the methods and the results
of estimates of the wealth of the United States of America have, in the main, been
taken from the publications of the Bureau of the Census, Washington, E.G.


     2.                           —
         Census of 1850. The first effort of the Government to obtain a statement of
the valuation of the property of the country was made under the Census Act of 1850.
The     instructions       on the schedules issued          to   United States marshals, through            whom
the census statistics for that year were collected, required those officers to obtain
statistics of the valuation of real and personal property as assessed for taxation,
and in addition          thereto the true valuation of siuih property.              For obtaining    this latter,
the schedules contained the following instructions                     :




               "   The                  property should be estimated at what is its cash
                         true valuation of all
        value in the place where            it isIn some places, however, it is valued by
                                                    situated.
        appraisers at two-thirds or one-half of its just value, and the assessment made
        upon such valuation. If in the estimate of an estate it is valued at other than
        its true worth, the true valuation should be stated, which may easily be done by

        adding the proper per centum to the recorded valuation."

        No
        valuation statistics of the above character were published in the final report
of the CensTJS of 1850, but a preliminary report by the Superintendent, which was
published as a Congress Paper, contained a table of such values under the heading
" real    and personal estate," with the following remark                      :




               "   The   table of real      and personal estate owned by individuals                is   made up
        from    official   returns of property for taxation.                Where   the assessment has been
        made on a sum less than the intrinsic worth, the assistant marshals were in-
        structed to add the necessary percentage. For the purposes of taxation the
        full amount is not generally given, in rural districts especially. Stocks or
        bonds owned by the States or by the General Government are not represented.
        The value        of slaves   is    included."

     The table mentioned is headed " valuation of real and personal estate of the
inhabitants of the United States for the year ending 1st June, 1850," and the total
true or estimated value is given as 87,135,780,228 (= £1,466,000,000 approximately,
i.e.,   on the basis       of .S4.86i to the £).



     3.                            —
         Census of 1860. At the Census of 1860 the marshals of the United States
were directed to obtain from the records of the States and Territories respectively,
an account of the value of real and personal estates as assessed for taxation. In-
structions were given these officers to add the proper amounts to the assessment, so
that the return should shew the true value as well as the inadequate sum generally
attached to the property for taxation purposes.     The aggregation of these returns
indicated that the value of individual property in the States and Territories amounted
to $16,159,616,068 {= £3,320,000,000 approximately, at S4.863 to
                                                                       the £).


        In the returns for 1850 and 1860 the value of                 all   taxable property was returned,
including that of foreigners              and non-residents,      as well as that of natives   and       residents,

while    all   property belonging to the State or Federal Government was excluded.

    4.                           —
        Census o£ 1870. In 1870 the duty of ascertaining the assessed and true
valuation of property was again entrusted to the United States marshals.  The
points particularly dwelt         upon   in the instructions      from the Census       Office   were   :




             (i. )   the undervaluation of real estate in assessments for taxation                 ;



            (ii.)    the large class of personal property lawfully           exempt from taxation           ;



            (iii.)   the class disregarded by assessors      ;




            (iv.)    the class which   by evasion   or fraud escapes taxation.

    In the report dealing with this census, it is stated that " for the majority of the
States and for the vast majority of the property of the country, the additions to be
made to assessed values on account of the undervaluation of real estate has been calculated
with great nicety by competent investigators.'" The report admits, however, that no
such accurate methods could be applied to make good the shortages due to exemp-
tions or escape of personal property from taxation in 1870, and states that the result
reached must be characterised rather as an impression than an opinion.        The
estimated true value of all taxable property was given for 1870 on a gold basis as
$24,054,814,806          (=   £4,940,000,000 approx., at $4.86i to the           £).



       5.      Census of 1880.   —At the Census      of 1880          a special effort was made to intro-
duce an       initial correction into    the statistics of the assessed valuation of real estate.
With this object a circular letter was addressed from the Census Office to a very large
number of bankers, real estate agents, and business men, as well as public officials
connected more or less directly with the valuation of property for the purposes of
taxation.  The letter enclosed a form of report drafted for the purpose of obtaining
an          statement of the methods of procedure adopted in the various localities
      explicit
in comiection with the valuation of real estate.     The main object of the inquiry was
that of ascertaining for the different classes of real estate the percentage of assessed
value to real value in the different localities.

       Over 25,000 replies to the circular were received, the majority of them exhibiting
both a disposition to     assist, and also -a fair comprehension of the purpose of the
inquiry.

       From an         analysis of the data so obtained,         it   was ascertained that the         ratios of
assessed to true valuation of real estate ranged                      from 40 to 100 per
                                                                             with an          cent.,
average for the country as a whole of 65 per cent. The percentage was in general
found to be highest in those States having a large urban population, and least in the
rapidly-growing States of the Upper Mississippi Valley.

       On
        previous occasions the estimates had related to taxable property only, but
at the Census of 1880, and those taken subsequently, an estimate was also made of
the value of property exempt from taxation, consisting mainly of the property of
Federal, State and Local Governments, and of religious, charitable and educational
institutions.

    In the reports dealing with the censuses subsequent to that of 1880, the esti-
mated values  of taxable and exempt property are shewii separatelj', but in that of
the 1880 Census the figm-es given relate to taxable and exempt property combined.
In 1890 the estimate for exempt property represented 5.9"(, of the combined total,
the corresponding percentage in 1900 being                  7,    while in 1904        it   was QA%, and        in
1912, 0.6%.            The combined      total value for taxable            and exempt property             ascer-
tained at the Census of 1880 was $43,642,000,000                         (= £8,968,000,000       at $4.86| to
the £).

    6.  Census of 1890.— At the Census of 1890 inquiries were sent
                                                                   to county and
municipal officers asking them to state what,
                                              in their opinion, was the relation be-
tween the assessed and the true value of the real
                                                  estate as respectively assessed by
them. To corroborate the reports furnished by these
                                                         officers, upwards of 25,000
inquiries were sent throughout the country to
                                               persons believed to    be   familiar with
the values of real estate, asking their opinion as
                                                   to the relation between the assessed
and true value in their respective localities. The replies received
                                                                       were considered
in connection with the reports of the assessors.   The value of farm lands as reported
by the census enumerators was also taken into consideration.
    The estimated value of property for the Census of 1890 was
                                                                   $65,037,091,197,
comprising taxable property 861,203,755,972, and exempt
                                                          property «3,833i335!225'
Again, taking S-t.865 to the f, these may be represented
                                                         approximately by taxable
property £12,577,000,000, and exempt property
                                                 £788,000,000, giving a combined
total of £13,365,000,000.



     7.                     —              —
         Census oJ 1900. (i.) General. The volume relative to wealth, debt and
taxation issued by the Bureau of the Census, Washington, in connection
                                                                             with the
Census of 1900, contains the results of two estimates of wealth, one in respect
                                                                                of the
year 1900, the other in respect of the year 1904. The former of these
                                                                       was authorised
by the Act of 3rd March, 1899, providing for the Twelfth Census, the latter In- the
Act of 6th March, 1902, establishing the permanent Census Office. In both cases the
particulars published relate to continental United States, that is, they are
                                                                             exclusive
of Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines.

     (ii.) Farm and                         —
                      Factory Property. For the year 1900 Congress specifically
authorised and directed that the value of property employed in agTiculture and manu-
factures as appraised by owners, occupiers or managers thereof should be ascer-
tained through the agency of census enumerators. The values so determined for
this class of property are   shewn   in the following table   :

 162                        The Inventory Method                       op Esthhating "Wealth.


 No complete appraisal of taxed real property had ever been made in the United States
 except by assessors tor purposes of taxation, and as the Census Act did not authorise
 the collection by census enumerators of such information for property other than that
 connected with farms and factories, the lists prepared by the taxation assessors
 were used as the basis for estimating the other kinds of real estate. For the purposes
 of this estimate                an endeavoxir was made              to ascertain the percentage of true value
represented in each case                  by the           and the Bureau of the Census
                                                      assessed valuation,
sought to utilise all the available information relating to the subject. The means
adopted comprised (i.) the comparison of farm values collected by the census
enumerators with assessed values for the same properties            (ii.) the comparison   ;



of selling prices with assessed values    (iii.) inquiries made by agents of the Bureau
                                                             ;


of the Census in practically all cities, villages and county seats from persons com-
petent to give information relating to the ratio between the assessed valuation and
the true value of real property                   ;
                                                      (iv.)      reports of such ratios given in financial pub-
lications       ;    (v.)   reports of State tax commissions                   and State equalisation boards.
        (iv.)       Exempt Real Property. —            ^In       estimating the value of real property exempt
from taxation, great                difficulty   was experienced           in all cases except   New York,   Massa-
chusetts,           New     Jersey,   and Pennsylvania.
     In the majority of cases the estimates of the value of exemipt real property were
prepared by using information secured from a number of sources, comprising amongst
           —
others : (i.) Special inquiries by census agents         (ii.) special returns supphed by
                                                                               ;


city authorities    (iii.) special returns from churches, schools and kindred institu-
                             ;



tions; (iv.) a uniform rate of $1.25 ( = 5s. 2W.) per acre assigned to the unappropriated
and reserved domain of the United States outside of Indian Territory and Oklahoma
(v.) in the two Territories mentioned » value equal to that assigned by farmers
who, as lessees, used it for agricultural purposes.
       (v.)         Live Stock.     —On    1st    June, 1900, the census enumerators recorded the
number and value of the various classes of domestic stock on farms, and the value                                of
poultry and bees on farms. They also recorded the nimaber, but not the value,                                    of
domestic stock not on farms. These latter were valued on the assumption that the
average value of each class of stock was the same as that ascertained for farms.
Poultry and bees not on farms were not recorded.

    ( vi. )                                                            —
            Farm Implements and Machinery. The figures given under this head for
1900 are those reported by the census enumerators in respect of farm implements
and machinery on farms at                  1st June, 1900.

facturing machinery, tools, and implements for 1900 were reported by the Census of
Manufactures for that year. The census was practically for the calendar year 1899,
and the value returned                  for   manufacturing machinery,                 tools,   and implements   is
therefore the value at the close of that year, or about 1st January, 1900, not 1st
June, 1900. No allowance for this tact was made in the final table, which conse-
quently, owing to increases between 1st January and 1st June, tends to imder-
estimate the value.

    (viii.) Gold and Silver Coin and Bullion.                              —
                                                The estimate used for these was
based upon the reports of the Director of the Mint, and of the Comptroller of the
Ciurency for the year 1900.
           Railroads and their Equipment.
       (ix.)                                                       —
                                            An extensive valuation of the railroads
and   theirequipment was made for the year 1904 by capitalising the net earnings of
individual railways and railway systems. To obtain figures for 1900, computations
were made to ascertain approximately the increase from 1900 to 1904, and the
figures for 1904 were reduced in accordance therewith.

     (x.) Street Railways, etc.   —
                                The value of street railways was obtained by methods
substantially the same as those adopted for estimating the commercial value of rail-
roads, and the same is true in a general way of the estimated value of telegraph and
telephone systems. The value of canals was assumed to be the same as that reported
at the Census of 1890.    The value of shipping was obtained by multiplying the ton-
nage afloat by the building cost per ton as reported by the 1900 Census of Manu-
factures, and deducting one-third for depreciation. To this was added the reported
cost of the ships of the United States Navy in active commission.

     The values of electric light and power stations are based upon the cost of con-
struction as estimated for the year 1902, with a deduction of twice the cost of new
construction during 1902.

        As privately-owned gas-works had already been included with            factories,   no
special estimates  were made for them.

        (xi.)                                                        —
                Products of Agriculture, Manufactures, and Mining. The value assigned
to agricultural products      was one-half the value of the crops reported by the Census
of Agriculture as raised in the year 1899 (being the quantity estimated as still in    hand
at 1st June, 1900), plus the value of the labour         which had been expended to         1st
June, 1900, on the crops of that year, and which was included in the value of the
growing crops at that date.
     The value of the products of manufactures was based wholly on the report of the
1900 Census of Manufactures. For the value of materials and products in the
possession of the factories, an amount was (apparently arbitrarily) allowed equal to
two months' " gross products'' of 1900. For the manufactured goods in the posses-
sion of merchants, an amount was allowed equal to one-half the annual " net
products " of the factory output, exclusive of hand trades.
     The value of the products of mines and quarries was based upon the census
report for mines and quarries for 1902, taken in conjunction with the reports of
Geological Survey for the years 1900 and 1902.

    In the case of imported merchandise it was assumed that the value of the im-
ports either inbonded warehouses or in the hands of traders on 1st June, 1900, was
equal to one-half the value of all such goods imported into the United States during
the year ended 30th June, 1900.

     (xii.) Clothing,                                                     —
                       Furniture and Kindred Personal Property. The estimated
value of clothing and personal adornments, including watches, jewellery, etc., con-
sisted substantially of the amounts which, on the basis of the 1900 Census of Manu-
factures and the import returns for 1900, it was estimated that the people of the
country expended for clothing and personal adornment for that year. An addition
of one-third was made to allow for the increase in value due to the cost of transporta-
tion and for the profit of the middleman.     A small further addition was made to
allow for the value of the    work in homes   in converting cloth into clothing.

     In estimating the value of such articles as fra-niture for houses and public build-
ings, books in libraries, carriages, bicycles, automobiles, harness, saddles and all
kindred articles other than clothing, it was loosely estimated that the value of all
these articles in the possession of the people or in public buildings was equal to four
years' purchases of the same articles.     The probable cost of four years' purchases
was then estimated from the value of the manufactured products and imports which
entered into the aggregate, one-third being added for the middleman's profits.
In this connection the foEowing account of the method adopted for valuing the cor-
responding items at the Census of 1880 is of interest. It is taken from the report
on that census       :

164                  The Inventory Method                     of Estimating Wealth.


              "   The number       of families in each State        was taken, and these were           dis-

       tributed, according to the statistics of occupation, into certain characteristic
       classes.  The average value of the household goods in the families of each class
      was then estimated                                      by item, the values given
                                   as thoughtfully as possible, item
       to the goods representing    what they were worth to the owner, or what it would
       cost to     replace them, with fair allowance for wear and tear   not what they     ;



      would be worth to sell as second-hand goods. These results, secondly, were
      checked by an independent computation, in which the annual product or
      importation of each class of household goods, furniture, clothing, watches and
      jewellery, pianos, sewing machines, etc., was taken into account, and an average
      life in use assigned to the goods of each class.  The result of this second and
      wholly independent computation was to afford a somewhat striking corrobora-
      tion of the conclusion reached by the first method.    Allowance was then made
      on account of the average quantity of food, fuel and other supplies on hand for
       domestic use."

       In the report of the Census of 1890, the corresponding estimate on that occasion
is   stated to have been          made   as follows   :




              " Of the miscellaneous, the value of furniture                   and personal belongings
       constitutes a large portion.          To    arrive at the value of such property    an examina-
       tion   was made       of   more than 8000 insurance         policies   on contents of houses not
       located in large        oities,         shewed the average value of furniture
                                         and the    result
       insraed in such houses to be S387. The value of private carriages and tools of
       mechanics is not known, but it is believed that for each house in the United
       States there would be of furniture, tools, and carriages an average amount of
       $400."


       (xiii.)     Aggregate
                        for 1900.            —
                                      The total estiiriated value for 1900 was
$88,517,306,775       £18,188,000,000 approx., at S4.86§ to the £). The sterling
                        (=
values of detailed items for 1900 will be found in the table on page 167 in conjvmction
with corresponding figures for 1904 and 1912.



     8. Estimate for 1904.           —
                             In preparing an estimate of the national wealth of the
United States of America for 1904, the Bureau of the Census followed as far as possible
the same procedure as was followed in the case of the estimate for 1900. The census
returns in respect of farm property, which were used in the 1900 estimate were,
however, lacking in the estimate for 1904, except in respect of the State of Iowa, for
which a census of agriculture was available for 1905. For this State an estimate for
1904 was prepared on the assumption that four-fifths of the increase recorded be-
tween 1900 and 1905 had accrued by 1904.         A similar assiunption was made in
respect of manufacturing machinery, tools, and implements, a Census of Manufactures
for the whole of the United States, having been taken in 1905.     The total value of
the national wealth recorded for 1904 was .$107,104,211,917 {= £22,008,000,000, at
 $4.86i to the        £).

       The    sterling values of detailed items for 1904 will be              found   in   the table on page
 167 in conjunction with corresponding figures for 1900 and 1912.

     (ii.)                                                    —
           Taxable real property and improvements.- The " true" value of such real
property was ascertained by obtaining for each of the States an estimate of the ratio
of true value to assessed valuation, and by applying these ratios to the aggregate
assessments of the several local authorities. The data obtained indicated that the
percentage of assessed valuation of real property and improvements on the true value
varied for the year 1912 from 11.7% for Iowa, and                 15%   for Nebraska, to   100%   for
New     Hampshire and "Wyoming.

    (m.) Exempt           real property   and improvements.   —For an estimate    of the value of
exempt property           itwas assumed that on the average such property amounted to
one-eighth of         the value of the taxed real property and improvements. This pro-
portion was based on an examination of the returns for the States of New Jersey,
New York and Ohio, and the District of Columbia, which were the only official
returns shewing the valuations of exempt property.

     (iv.) Live stock.         —
                       The valuations of the principal classes of domestic animals on
farms were taken from the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for 1912,
which gives the estimated value as at 1st January, 1913. The values of other classes
of live stock on farms, domestic animals not on farms, and poultry and bees were
based upon the Census report for 1909, with an allowance for increased value from
1909 to 1912, based on the annual increase from 1899 to 1909.

     (v.) Farm implements and machinery.           —
                                            The estimates for 1912 were prepared by
adding to the values reported in the Census of Manufactures for 1909, a value based
on the average annual rate of increase from 1899 to 1909.

      (vi.   )                       tools, and implements.
                 JMa nufacturing machinery,                         —
                                                            The value of manufactur-
ing machinery, tools,  and implements was not separately shewn in the returns for
the Census of 1909, but was included with other capital. In obtaining an estimate
for these items for 1912 it was assumed that they represented the same proportion of
the total manufacturing capital as was ascertained for 1904. The estimated value of
capital in 1912, including machinery, etc., was obtained by applying the annual rate
of increase from 1904 to 1909.

      (vii.)      Gold and
                   silver coin and bullion.           —
                                            The value of gold and silver coin and
bullion for 1912was obtained by deducting from the total figures of the Director of
the Mint, the amounts held by the banks in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Bico, and the
Philippine Islands.

     (viii.) Railroads and their equipments.          —
                                              The valuation for 1912 was obtained
from a report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which shewed the total valua-
tion of road and equipment for all railroads in the United States. From this total
a   reserve for depreciation of certain of the railroads          was deducted.

      (ix.)      Street railways.   —The estimated value of    street railways   was based upon
the cost of construction.

      (x.)       Telegraph systems.   —The estimate   for telegraph systems,     which was based
upon  cost of construction, includes land telegraph systems, ocean cable telegraph
systems, and wireless telegraph systems. The value of wireless systems was reported
in 1912 to  be $1,205,770 (= £248,000).                No   valuation for wireless systems was
included in previous wealth estimates.

      (xi.)      Telephone systems.    —The estimate   for telephone    systems was based upon
the cost of construction.
      (xii.)                                                        —
                  Pullman and other cars not owned by railroads. The estimate of the value
of these cars       was based on returns furnished to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
166                  The Inventory Method op Estimating Wealth.

      (xiii.)   Shipping and canals.       —The estimate for mercantile shipping was based
upon    a,   special investigation       made by the Bureau of the Census for 1906. The
figures so obtained were brought up to date by allowances for the value of ships
constructed from 1906 to 1912, based on the Census of Manufactures of 1904 and 1909,
and by deductions for the value of shipping lost, etc., based on the report of the
Bureau of Navigation for the period 1907 to 1912.
     The vessels of the United States Navy in active commission, light vessels and
tenders of the Lighthouse Service, vessels of the Revenue-Cutter Service, and the
floating equipment of the War Department were added at cost.
     The valuation of canals used for commercial purposes, or leased to railroads,
was obtained from various sources.     The figures for State and corporation canals
were taken largely from various State reports, and those Federal Government
canals and canalized rivers from reports of the Chief Engineer of the United States
Army.
      (xiv.)     Irrigation enterprises.    —These      are situated in the Western States, and
were not included        in estimates of     wealth for 1900 and 1904.
      (xv.) Privately -owned waterworks.            —The value assigned    to these   works   for 1912
was that     of 1900,   with a small increase.
      (xvi.)     Privately -owned central electric light ajid power systems.        —The estimated
value of these works was based upon the cost of construction.
      (xvii.)    Privately -owned gas systems.        —
                                                      The estimated value of these works was
not separately shewn, as          it   has already been included in the returns of the Census of
Manufactures.
      (xviii.)                                 —
                                     The valuation of the principal classes of agri-
                  Agricultural products.
cultural crops was taken from the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for
the year 1912. The valuation of other agricultural crops was taken from the Census
report of 1909, with an allowance for the increase from 1909 to 1912. The value of
agricultural products in the possession of farmers             and traders at the 31st December,
1912,   was estimated      to   be   90%   of the value of the crops of that year.

     (xix.) Manufactured products.             —
                                      The value of manufactures in 1912 was esti-
mated by adding to the valua in 1909 an increase based on that experienced between
1904 and 1909. The value of exports of principal domestic manufactures was de-
ducted to obtain value for domestic use.       It was then assumed that one-twelfth
of the value of foodstuffs and one-half of the value of other products for domestic
use were in the possession of merchants, and that the value of materials and products
in the hands of factories was one-sixth of the gross products for 1912.

     (xx.) Imported merchandise.            —
                                  The value of imported merchandise in bonded
warehouses and in the hands of traders was assximed to be one-half of the value of
all such goods imported during 1912 into the United States, exclusive of Alaska,
Hawaii, and Porto Rico.
       (xxi.)    Mining   Products.    —The value     of the mineral production for 1912   was taken
from the report of the Geological Survey.                 The value
                                                                  and other derived
                                                                      of pig-iron
products was eliminated, being already included with manufactures.        It was as-
sumed that the whole of the coal produced in 1912 and one-tenth of the other mineral
products were on hand at 31st December, 1912, the balance of the other mineral
products being accounted for in the hands of the manufacturers, etc.
      (xxii.) Clothing and articlrs of personal adornment.            —
                                                            The value taken for articles
of a perishable nature, such as clothing, furnishings, dress goods, cosmetics, perfumes,
etc., was that of such articles manufactured and imported during 1912.         The               value
taken for       articles of a   more or    less   permanent value, such as jewellery of    all   kinds

watches, etc., was obtained by adding the value of the articles of this class manu.
factured and imported from 1902 to 1912 inclusive to the value of such articles as
were held in 1902,      less one-half for loss   and destruction.
     (xxiii.)     Furniture, carriages and kindred property.        —For     articles in this   group
which were considered as         perishable, such as kitchen utensils, fancy goods, trunks,
valises, etc., only the product of 1912 was used.    For those articles which might
reasonably be expected to retain a considerable portion of their original value, such as
household furniture, automobiles, musical instruments, carriages, sewing machines,
etc., the value of the products for the years 1904 to 1912 inclusive, and the net im-
ports for the same period, were added to 20% of the value of the products of this
class   on hand      in 1904.  A deduction was made on account of loss and deprecia-
tion, while to      account lor stock in trade already included under other heads a deduc-
tion of   50%     of the total manufactures and imports for 1912 was made.

     CHAPTER I.—ESTIMATES OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH OF THE
                                     UNITED KINGDOM.


     1.   General.    —In the case of the United Kingdom there has, up to the present,
been no    official   estimate of the wealth of the Kingdom as a whole or of any of its
component       parts.    Numerous estimates of varying degrees of reliability have, how-
ever, been   made by various investigators, the bases of such estimates being also very
varied.     Much of the material given hereunder concerning the early estimates of
wealth has been obtained from Gifien's " Growth of Capital," published in 1889.



     2.                                                 —
            William Petty's estimate (about 1679). One of the earliest of these
          Sir
estimates   was that made bySir 'iVilliam Petty, the founder of the so-called " Political
Arithmetic." In this estimate, as originally prepared, an item was included for a
capital valuation of the income from personal services, but in Giffen's review the
amount is omitted as not being on all fours with the other items in the estimate, and
not being comparable with subsequent estimates based upon Income Tax Returns.
With the exclusion of the item mentioned, Petty's estimate was as follows      :

but   it   has been omitted from the table given below, since   it is,   in essence,      an estimate
of the value of the      human   beings constituting the population, not an estimate of
their realised wealth.      With   this omission King's estimate   is    as follows   :

     7. Oiffen's estimates for 1865 and 1875.     —
                                                 In a paper read before the Royal
Statistical Societyi in 1878, Sir Robert Giffen furnished estimates of the wealth of
the United Kingdom for the years 1865 and 1875. In referring in the course of his
paper to the determination of existing capital, Giffen says: " The most convenient
basis for such a, proceeding appears now to be the income tax assessments. The
method   is   to discriminate as far as possible in these returns the different sources of
income, capitalise these at a suitable number of years' purchase, and then make an
allowance or conjecture for the capital of the income not liable to income tax, or
which otherwise escapes assessment, and for capital which is not treated in the
income tax returns as income yielding."


     As the method employed is one of some importance, it has been deemed advis-
able to give in full Giffen's table exhibiting his data, and the calculations employed
in computing the estimated capital value.

172                        Miscellaneous Estimates           oi*   Wealth.


      The income    assessed for taxation which       was not brought to account for capital-
isation in this estimate comprised       (i.)                income from trades and profes-
                                                four-fifths of
sions (under Schedule D), £140,000,000,     (ii.) the permanent charge on the national

debt for 1875-6, viz., £21,737,000, and (iii.) Schedule E, made up of salaries, pensions
and annuities not earned by capital, totalling £32,540,000. These three items of
income totalled £194,277,000.

      The   total wealth   shewn above,   viz.,    £8,548,120,000, represents about £259 per
head of the population of some 33,000,000.

     It may be noted that this method of estimating is, in essence, a variant of the
inventory method, the values of the various assets being in the main based upon a
papitalisation of the income which they realise.

      In the same paper Giffen makes an estimate for the United Kingdom on similar
lines for 1865, and obtains a total of £6,114,063,000, or £204 per head of the then
population of 30,000,000.



     8. Giffen's estimate Sor 1885.   —
                                      In his work on "The Growth of Capital,"
Giffen gives an estimate for the United Kingdom for 1885, based upon data and cal-
culations of the same nature as those indicated in the preceding section as having-
been used for the 1865 and 1875- estimates. The total obtained for 1885 was
£10,037,436,000, or £279 per head of the then population of 36,000,000.       In the
preparation of the 1885 estimate some minor alterations were made in the number of
years' purchase adopted for the capitalisation of incomes. In some cases the number
was increased, and in others diminished, the aggregate for 1885 being affected less,
than a half of one per cent, by the change.



      9.   Giffen's Estimate for 1903.   —
                                       A further estimate was made by Sir Robert
Giffen for a paper contributed by him to the Economics and Statistics Section of the
British Association in September, 1903. ^ This estimate, however, which was not
the main object of the paper, was not prepared with the same analysis of detail as
characterised his estimates for 1865, 1875, and 1885, and cannot be regarded as more
than a very rough approximation made to furnish a convenient working basis for the
consideration of modes of expenditure. In addition to an estimate for the United
Kingdom the paper contains similar estimates in respect of Canada, Australasia,
India, South Africa, and the remainder of the Empire.

      The    figure so given for the wealth of the       United Kingdom is £15,000,000,000,.
or £355 per head of the population, which in 1903               was about 42,250,000. The
figures given in the   paper for the British Empire are as follows       :

     These figures have been somewhat extensively quoted, e.g., by Augustus D.
\Vebb, F.S.S., in " The New Dictionary of Statistics" for
                                                           1911, and by the Bureau
of the Census, ^^'ashulgton, but it is clear
                                             from the context of the paper in which
they appear that they were not put forward by the author
                                                             as representing in most
cases anything more than what may be termed "

        Harris and Lake's estimate, 1903-6.— In a paper read before the Royal
Statistical Society'on 18th December, 1906, Messrs. Harris and Lake discussed the-
compilation of wealth estimates on the basis of probate returns (see Part V. hereof).
As the result of the calculations so made supplemented by estimates in respect of
property not subject to death duties, the total wealth of the United Kingdom at or
about the end of 1904 was estimated at £9,207,000,000, thus falling short of Giffen's
rough estimate, quoted     in Section 9, by nearly £6,000,000,000.   In view of the
analysis of the limitations of the probate method given in Part V. hereof, there is
little doubt that the estimate of Messrs. Harris and Lake is very much in defect.


        11. Mallet's estimate,               —
                          1905 and 1906. In a paper read before the Royal Statis-
tical           on 18th February, 1908, Mr. (now Sir) Bernard Mallet further
         Society,   2

discussed the question of estimates based on probate returns, and in the course of
his paper gave an estimate for England and Wales of £5,500,000,000, on the basis
of the 1905 returns, and £6,098,000,000, on the basis of the 1906 returns,
irrespective of any allowance on account of property not subject to death duties.
For the reasons already referred to, it is probable that these estimates are much
below the truth (see Part V. hereof).

method  of capitalising incomes, Mr. L. G. Chiozza Money' gave as ". total for the
Wealth of the United Kingdom in 1908 a sum of £13,762,000,000, or £313 per head
on a population of some 44,000,000.

                                  On p. 127 of his work, already mentioned (" The
Growth of Capital"), Giffen quotes M. de Foville as having furnished in his " La
France Economique " particulars cf several estimates of the value of property in
France, and gives the following summary of some of the more important of these   :

comparable with each other or with estimates for other countries.

      In all cases where the wealth was less than £50,000 (1,000,000 marks), the total
was obtained by multiplying the number of cases by the middle value of the range ;
in all cases where the individual wealth was greater than £50,000 the true totals^were

      CHAPTER I.—LIMITATIONS AND USES OF WEALTH ESTIMATES.

     1.   Limitations   —cannot be too strongly emphasised that by whatsoever
                            It
means an estimate                     community Is compiled, the resultant figures
                           of the wealth of a
can never be regarded as more than rough approximations. Normally the wealth
of an individual at any given moment may, from certain points of view, be said to
be represented by the market value of the property of various kinds of which he is
then in possession, the tacit assumption made being that a market exists for each
class of property.  Although such a basis of valuation might be said to be inapplic-
able to the wealth of the whole community, because of the impossibility of treating
it as all subject to sale at the same moment, it may nevertheless be supposed that the

individual items of wealth might be sold under conditions conforming to the general
state of the community.       In this case the aggregate of the values can be taken to be
the aggregate wealth expressed in terms of money.

    Apart from this assumption of a hypothetic possibility of                    sale, it is often   not
practicable to determine a reliable value for certain of the private possessions, even
though these contribute largely to the well-being of the community. In most of
such cases the cost would be too high to take for the purposes of a valuation, while the
price likely to be realised at a forced sale would usually represent far less than the
value of the possessions io the owner in the absence of such a sale. These and similar
limitations apply to all valuations available for the purpose of wealth-estimates,
whether such valuations are made in respect of probate returns, for war census
purposes, or for the purposes of an inventory estimate. A review of the conclusions
relative to these several methods of estimation is given in succeeding chapters.

    In addition to the limitations which result from valuation                  difficulties, there are
others that arise, in the case of comparative returns, from differences in the methods
and minutise of estimation adopted at the several dates in respect of the estimates
constituting the subject of comparison.     Thus, the comparison of an estimate based
on probate returns                        with an inventory estimate for a date not
                            for a given period
included in that period might suggest an increase or decrease in the wealth of the
community, though this might be largely fictitious, owing to failure to take into
account the characteristic peculiarities of the several estimates. For this reason, it is
essential that an estimate for which any degree of reliability is claimed should be
accompanied by an explicit account of the method adopted, and, where practicable,
a detailed review of the contributing items. Without this the significance of the
estimate for comparative purposes is not sufficiently definite.

     Another limitation to such estimates          is   that due to   tlie persoiial   equation of the
observer.     This   is,   of course, true of all observations,   but   is   especially in evidence in
the present case, where the judgments of different observers enter so largely into the
question. For example, in a determination of the values of real estate in the Com-
monwealth by the inventory method, an aggregation       is made for Australia of the
valufH allocated to different properties           by
                                               the mmiicipal valuers of some 1070
different local governing bodies.     Similar considerations apply to individual
estimates in the case of a wealth census or of a return for probate pvirposes, and are
also applicable to the exercise of       judgment on the part of the statistician responsible
for the estimate.

       2.   Uses.     —
                     In his work " The growth of capital," previously quoted, Giffen
indicates        numerous uses to which estimates of wealth may be put, of which the fol-
lowing      is   a   summary   :




     (i.) To measure the accumulation of capital in communities at intervals of                     some
length (not less perhaps than ten years).

       (ii.)     To compare the income         of a   community, where estimates of income      exist,
with    its     property.
       (iii.)    To measure the burden         of national debts   upon   different commiinities.

       (iv.)     To measure,       in conjunction with other factors such as aggregate income,
revenue and population, the relative strength and resources of different communities.
       (v.)      To   indicate generally the proportions of the different descriptions of pro-
perty in a country to the total           — how the wealth of a community          is   composed.
       (vi.)    To measure the progress of a community from period to period, or the
relative       progress of two or more communities, in conjunction with facts as to pro-
gress in income, revenue, population, etc.

          To compare the aggregate accumulation in a community with that portion
       (vii.)

of theaccumulation which can be described as free savings, which latter is gradually
invested through the agency of the Stock Exchange.

    (viii.) To throw light on the question of changes in the value of money (which

changes are themselves among the facts to be investigated and allowed for in com-
paring the valuations of different countries or the valuations of the same country at
different times).

       To the uses above           specified   may    be added the following, which are available in
respect of a wealth and income census, and to                 some extent in respect of an estimate
based on probate returns              :




          To determine the distribution of wealth amongst the individual members
       (ix.)

of the community, and thus to furnish a measure of the relative degree of opulence
or penury of the various classes and the number of persons in each of such classes.

       (x.)      To enable a comparison        of wealth with   income to be made in respect of the
various classes.

                        order to be applicable to the purposes indicated above, the
       It is clear that in
estimate, however made,    must represent a fairly close approximation to the actual
facts, but in view of what has already been said in sec. 1 of the present Chapter, it is
evident that close accuracy is unattainable, and in some respects may even be said
not to be susceptible of exact definition.




                       CHAPTER       II.— CENSUS        OF WEALTH AND INCOME.

     1. General.          —
                  From the nature of the case, it might be assumed that the most
complete and accurate record of the wealth of the community would be obtained by
asking the information of the individual owners themselves, in other words, by taking
a wealth census, and in some respects this assumption is often warranted. It is
however.subject to various limitations and conditions, which will be considered in the
succeeding sections.

     2. War Census of 1915.    —
                               As previously stated, a census of wealth was taken in
1915 in connection withthe census of males of military age, but owing to its emerg-
ency character, and the fact that the returns were not distributed or collected as in
the case of a census of population, there were serious defects in the numbers of per-
sons furnishing returns, and less serious though probably important shortages in the
total amount as compiled from the returns. The total amount recorded was approxi-
mately f 1 ,643,000,000, but from the nature of the case there are evidently no means
of determining even approximately the    amount of wealth omitted by default in the
supply of returns. The machinery of the War Census Act threw upon the members
of the community the responsibility for the supply of the information, the requisite
forms, envelopes, etc., being made available at all post offices. With such a method,
and in the absence of a record of the people liable to make returns, it is clear that the
detection of default except in certain accidental cases beconaes almost an impossi-
bility.



     3. Advantages and disadvantages of census method.       —A marked feature of the
wealth census method of obtaining the desired information is the fact that particulars
can be obtained by it of the ntmiber and amount of estates of any given size, and
further, that by including provision for a record of income on the census form, valuable
information concerning the relation of wealth to income under various circumstances
can be satisfactorily obtained with a minimum of labour.

     A further advantage of the method is the fact that the information being fur-
nished in each case by the owner, the labour of valuation is widely distributed, and is
made by the person who, in the majority of cases, is moat intimately in touch with the
requisite data.   Associated with this advantage, however, is the disadvantage that
in certain cases the fear of subsequent taxation conduces to undervaluation.

      The                               method is the cost which such a census neces-
            principal disadvantage of the
sarily entailsowing to the large volume of detailed particulars which is presented for
tabulation and compilation. Another disadvantage is the necessity which exists
for the observation of the strictest secrecy in respect of the returns furnished. The
extreme sensitiveness of many members of the community in this respect is such as
probably to render inapplicable the method of collection adopted at an ordinary
population census. Special machinery for the collection of the data would thus be
necessitated, thereby increasing the expense and delaying the publication of the
results.



     4. Suggestions for future action.- —
                                        In view of the fact that the wealth and income
census gives important results in respect of the community which are not obtainable
by any other method    of estimation, it appears desirable that such a census should be
taken every ten years in conjunction with the ordinary population census now provided
for under the " Census and Statistics Act 1905."      By such means the cost referred
to above would be considerably reduced, as the wealth and income census forms could
be distributed by the census collectors, and if no objection were offered by the person
making the                                              form with the ordinary popula-
              return, the collector could also collect the
tion returns.    In those cases in which there is an objection to disclosing the par-
ticulars in respect of wealth and income to a local resident (the collector) even though
under an oath of secrecy, arrangements could be made for the collector to furnish an
envelope for the transmission of the form post free to the Commonwealth Statistician,
and could, by a note to this effect in his record book, ensure that the person to   whom
the envelope was issued would not be overlooked in the event of default.

CHAPTER in.— SUCCESSION METHOD OF ESTIMATING PRIVATE WEALTH.

     1 Succession methods.
        .                             —
                            Estimates of private wealth baaed upon any form of the
succession method really depend upon a correct determination of the proportion of
the aggregate of wealth which passes in a unit of time ( 1 year). The limitations of
the method have already been indicated in Part V., see in particular sec. 39.,
                                                                               p. 131,
where conclusions regarding the probate method are set out. In any attempt to
accurately ascertain the proportion of all wealth which passes in a year, it has tu be
remembered that the proportion in question depends upon the sex and for successions
proper (i.e., by death, as in probate cases), upon the death-rates according to sex.
Obviously, also, it depends upon the amount passing by "settlements" {i.e., by
gifts at marriage, or otherwise).  Estimates of aggregate wealth are in defect when-
ever wealth passes without record, and the clrcimistances of settlement must be
accurately known as regards the ages both of the donors and donees, for only in this
way can the proportion passing in a unit of time be known. A little consideration
will shew that so far as marriage settlements are concerned the rate of " passing"
is appreciably greater than the passing of wealth by the death of its possessor.

      To ascertain the proportion of wealth passing by death, it is strictly necessary
to   know the death-rate according to the wealth possessed, if the average death-rate
vary with the wealth possessed.                       Hence, inquiry into this question                is   essential   if

high precision be aimed at

    Estimates of wealth for probate are likely to be always in defect, consequently
their correction should be attempted. The factor of correction may, however, itself
change with time that has to be ascertained.
                          ;




      At the present time there                is   no adequate   statistic   which could form a perfectly
satisfactory basis for succession estimates, but there                           is no reason why in any

civically disciplined         community such            statistic   should not be available.



     2. Statistical lequiiements foi an accurate succession method.    The statistical           —
requirements for the accurate ascertainment of the rate of succession, i.e., the pro-
portion of wealth passing in a unit of time (1 year, say) is therefore        —                    :




      (i.)       Record of deaths according to age, sex, wealth possessed.

      (ii.   )   Record of the numbers living in the same categories.

      (iii.)      Record of the ages          of donors of wealth,      and    of the donees also, together
"with the         amounts donated         :



            (a) in   the case of settlements at marriage, and
            (6)   in the case of other settlements,

      (iv.)       Variations in numbers of deaths, marriages, etc.

     It has to be borne in mind that all attempts to ascertain the ratio of the li\'ing
to the dying, for any sex, age, and class, from mortality tables, is liable to consider-
able error, and also that in limited populations the experience of a single year will
not give sufficiently large numbers to furnish representative or average results.
The succession method then must always be deemed one                               of inferior accuracy.


    The          essential limitation of the succession methods               is   that   it   must necessarily be
assumed that the proportion                   of the aggregate of private wealth passing in a unit of

time will be constant         if   the death-rate and general conditions of the community are
180                                      Conclusions.


constant.   This assumption is doubtless on the whole valid, but reveals the intrinsic
nature of the estimate, viz., that it is one which does not apply to any given moment
of time, but gives     —             —
                     presumably a result which is an average over the period from
which the data are drawn.
     In regard to the absolute value of the estimate, it may be also noted that, inas-
much   as the ratio of the living to the dying is a large one, and varies from age to age,
the errors or any peculiarities in the data are correspondingly magnified in the result.




            CHAPTER IV.—THE INVENTORY METHOD OF ESTIMATION.

    1. General.    —
                  Of all estim,ates of wealth, the method which involves the smallest
expenditure of public fimds is that usually known as the inventory method. This
apparent saving, however, is not due to paucity of data, but to the fact that the
estimates so    made are based very largely on statistical data which have been obtained
for other purposes,  and which require relatively little work to reduce them to the form
requisite for the purposes of the valuation.  In ultimate analysis the sources of
information are both numerous and varied, as is evident from a review of the
details given in Part VI., Chapter I. hereof.


     2. Advantages and disadvantages of the inventory method.       —
                                                                 As just mentioned,
one of the advantages of the method is cheapness, owing to utilisation of existing
data.   This feature leads to the further advantage that the estimates may be made
at much shorter intervals than in the case when relatively expensive methods are
employed.
      A further advantage is that, from the nature of the method the data are available
in groups according to the nature of the wealth, but this is    accompanied by the dis-
advantage that the method does not furnish means for the classification of wealth
according to the size of the estates involved, and does not furnish any facilities for a
detailed comparison of assets and income.       The limitations of this method arising
from the difficulty of assigning an appropriate value to certain classes of possessions
are common to all valuations. For example, in the case of such items as furniture,
clothing, household and personal effects, etc., it is probable that an estimate based on
a consideration of the population and the number of dwellings of different sizes and
rentals is at least as sound as the estimates under such heads furnished at a wealth
census or in probate returns.


      3.   Suggestions for future action.   —Owing to the small cost involved,   it   appears
desirable that an estimate of wealth   on the inventory basis should be made every
five years, or with shorter intervals.  The more frequent estimates would naturally
lead to improvement in the basis atlopted under the various heads, and would thus
tend to increase the reliability of the estimates. Owing to its essential limitations,
however, it appears desirable that an inventory estimate made say, quinquennially,
should be supplemented by a decennial census of wealth. By such means extensive
information of a valuable character would be available in respect of the material
progress of the community. It would also be advisable in the preparation of sub-
sequent estimates of this character to supplement the particulars concerning private
wealth by obtaining estimates in respect of such national and communal wealth as is
capable of valuation.
